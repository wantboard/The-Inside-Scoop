Great place to go with friends on a night on the town.\nInsanely good food. Worth trying to get a reservation if possible\nWe loved our meal at this new Italian spot by the WB bridge. Excellent pastas and veggies. Did the gelato steal the show? So good.\nThis restaurant deserves all the hype. Everything was so gooood and the attention from Austin was incredible\nhmm, don't get the hype. We had white asparagus with pecorino, the crostini with whipped riccota, sauteed trumpet mushrooms, nduja bucatini, and tomato rigatoni. Dishes didn't seem to be all that balanced and the olive oil was a bit flat. Pasta took forever to come. Waiter was very nice though\nThe communication is very poor. There's not an easy way to make reservations or find out information. They do not respond to requests or phone calls even when they're open.\n\"came here for the second time after a couple years. it\u2019s definitely still as good as i remember - and definitely leagues ahead of lilia.\n\nwe had the artichoke and white asparagus to start. they were both divine. the asparagus had a great mint salsa - kind of like chimichurri. and the guanciale with the white asparagus was to die for.\n\nthe pastas we had were also top notch. one was pomodoro somethjng, the other gnocchi. the gnocchi for quite cold by the time we were able to finish it (not that long at all) which was a little disappointing but otherwise both were great.\n\nalso the mint stracciatela ice cream \u2026. holy moly. gone in a minute.\n\nwe had a couple glasses of lambrusco as well - it complemented the meal perfectly. all in all very great experience with lovely, not too overbearing service.\"\nThe best pasta and gelato in NYC. 10/10\nService was excellent. The best thing on the menu was ricotta crostini. We ordered two pastas (sheep milk ravioli and lamb pasta) and both were very salty which was disappointing for a restaurant that is so difficult to get into.\nHad a lovely experience at Misi. We had the coveted ricotta toast with seasonal ramps, the occhi raviolis, and the gnocchi. When it came time for dessert I was torn between my favorite, pistachio, and trying something unique, olive oil. I went with olive oil and to my delight they brought out both. Awesome service and scrumptious food!\nPerfect casual dining!\nRicotta toast, everyone knows this is great but the sleeper hit was the spinach and marscapone filled tortelli with brown butter. This incredibly rich and somehow light pasta was perfect for sharing and blew us away.\nMisi and Lilia are the best pastas in the city hands down. Innovative, fresh & absolutely delicious.\nI made a reservation online and had a question about it but it was impossible to talk to somebody from this place. I called 6+ times for the past few days and they never picked up, and I left voice messages as instructed but they never got back to me. It  feels like they totally ignore their customers just because they are known to be a decent restaurant in nyc. Absolutely arrogant and poor service\nThe restaurant is pretty good but their pastas are very disappointing. Quick tip for you is to order this ricotta spread on bread for appetizer (best dish of the night!) and their gelato. Spend your money else for good pasta.\nHad a dinner reservation booked before walking in but was not even seated at an actual table and instead the bar area which have backless uncomfortable stools.

The cauliflower was good and the pasta I got was as well. Must try the olive oil gelato to finish too.\n\nSat at the bar and seats were a little uncomfortable - drinks were great.\"\n\"Overhyped but excellent. Great use of acidity. Definitely get the gelato. Oh, and skip the cocktails.\n\nMisi has become an almost mythical / legendary Italian restaurant with impossible-to-get reservations. Considering how far away it is from me, I am not trying my luck with a walk-in. I\u2019ve been trying to get a spot for a few months to no avail until now.\n\nObjectively, Misi is an excellent restaurant. Its reputation is just absurdly high that it\u2019s hard for any restaurant to live up to the hype. Expect great food but don\u2019t expect Misi to redefine pasta as you know it.\n\nThe cooking style in a nutshell: everything is drenched in oil but never feels greasy. Normally I\u2019d complain about over-greased food, but Misi\u2019s use of acidity and aromatics add so much lightness and brightness that you forget the food is sitting in a puddle of oil.\n\nThe gelato is delicious, fully worth the price. There\u2019s always room for gelato\u2014order it. If Misi decides to open a gelateria, I\u2019d expect it to draw crowds.\n\nCocktails were the only weak point. The martini is properly chilled but overly diluted. The negroni\u2026 I can\u2019t exactly say what, but something feels missing.\"\n\"Great location, wonderful staff. We showed up over an hour early with our starving bellies and the servers so kindly accommodated us.\n\nI enjoyed the pasta but thought that it could\u2019ve used a bit more chew. Still, the occhi was spectacular. The olive oil gelato also blew me away.\"\n\"First visited after they opening in December 2018 and was very happy to finally nab a reservation and return. Still worth all the hype. Absolutely gorgeous space, with the most delicious food and excellent service. Impossible not to have a great time or meal here. Ordering is the toughest part because everything is so mouthwatering and fresh. Ordered the following:\n\n- negroni sours (to die for)\n- white asparagus, guanciale, pecorino, black pepper (beautiful)\n- marinated butter beans, ramps sott'olio, smoked ricotta (ramps were very vinegary and wonderful)\n- sheep's milk ricotta filled occhi, bottarga, lemon (MY FAV)\n- chitarra, braised lamb, pepperoncini (savory, delicious)\n- homemade live oil gelato\n\nEverything was above and beyond.

The atmosphere was brilliant, especially at the kitchen counter. Being able to watch brilliant chefs and cooks cook delicious food up close was a great experience. I'm excited to return.\nFantastic italian place. We did not order the ricotta crostini, and the waiter brought it anyways by mistake. Probably they assumed our order was wrong because everyone gets it! It was fantastic, and would definitely recommend.\n\"Our dinner at Misi was a 3.5/5 stars. The appetizers and the gelato were amazing, definitely the stars of the show for me, but the pasta\u2026.not so much.\n\nAppetizers: We had the marinated leeks and grilled broccoli as appetizers, both delicious!\n\nPasta: The pasta wasn\u2019t bad by any means, but I felt for a place that specializes in it, the pasta dishes should have been incredible. I was able to point out at least one thing about each pasta dish that could be improved. Spinach & marscapone tortellini were great, the burst of creaminess was really nice, but the butter sauce should have been browned more to bring out the deeper flavors. The sauce of the Bucatini with nduja was really flavorful, a little spicy which I loved, however was over salted. Not sure if it was the pecorino on top (which is a really salty cheese), or if it was the sauce itself, but the dish could have used a little less salt. The chitarra pasta was over cooked, so the noodles itself were too soft. The lamb and sauce was also not as memorable or interesting compared to the other two pasta dishes we got.\n\nDessert: I\u2019m very glad we finished off with the gelato because it was SO GOOD. We ordered the espresso and hazelnut one and both were amazing, and paired well together too.\n\nVerdict: It was a good meal, but not mind blowing. I think if I were to return, it would be just for the appetizers and gelato. Everything is based on personal taste though, so I would recommend trying Misi out once yourself and form an opinion on your own then!\"\nGreat fresh pasta, everything was perfect.\nRating is largely based on service and atmosphere. Food is good, though Lilia is better. One female bartender hated her job apparently, or she just got Botox and couldn\u2019t have any facial expression. Zero service from her, not even a perfunctory \u201chow\u2019s everything.\u201d Kept asking me if I needed another drink. The reception people were weird too.

I will definitely return. Thanks Misi!\"\nAbsolutely LOVED the food at Misi. The atmosphere is also stunning and the service was fabulous.\nWhipped ricotta lives up to the hype\nLove it\n\"Delicious Italian with quite expansive vegetarian options. Everything is made with tons of butter and cheese so it is not vegan friendly. I\u2019d say about 50% of the menu is vegetarian though! The ricotta crostini was served with charred peppers and marjoram. It was delicious but VERY filling. That combined with the slow cooked butter beans was almost too much food before getting a pasta dish- but the beans were lovely. I ordered the chickpea parpadelle BUT I was honestly disappointed because the seasoning was quite similar to the baked butter beans (with rosemary, butter, lemon and Parmesan). My partner loved the sheep\u2019s milk stuffed occhi with cured fish roe.\n\nOur server, Chloe, was absolutely lovely and so helpful with our dietary restrictions- including food allergies.\"\nPerfect food and amazing service from Chloe. Most menus options are vegetarian which is a change from the usual Italian fare. The only downer is the front of house staff are pretentious and cold towards customers whilst being friendly to each other.\nAmazing pasta!\nI have been dying to try Misi ever since I heard of it. I am a HUGE pasta lover and actually have the owner's cookbook titled PASTA. I am very happy we were able to get reservations (sign up for notifications on Resy and check email regularly) and try Misi, but we will not be going back. We ordered three pasta dishes an appetizer, and a cocktail. It was a good amount of food for the two of us. While the pasta was good, it was nothing to write home about, I feel like I can make just us good pasta at home.

Get the ricotta toast\nGreat pasta choices and the ricotta toast is a must.\nAppetizers (ricotta toast, beans, especially the mushrooms) and the gelato (pistachio, hazelnut, chocolate) were the highlights. Pasta was okay (we tried the gnocchi, fettuccine, and two other varieties) and the radicchio and olive oil ice cream were misses for me.\nFirst time, loved everything!

Also not pictured -  the gelato, so fresh and creamy, it\u2019s a must have!!\n11/10 experience. So delicious and not too heavy for pasta. Loved the space as well.

Ambiance is great, wine was great, ricotta toast with mushrooms good. The problem is, a month later, the rest of our entire meal was pretty forgettable. We got two apps (one being the toast) and the other being the the grilled artichokes? For main pastas, again I'd say it was fine, portions were small. We got the Fettuccine, the Occhi, and another which I don't remember. The Fettuccine was amazing- and happens to be one of more simpler dishes on the menu in terms of construction- which just shows you don't need to do too much to have a great pasta dish. The Occhi was overly salty and tasted like butter. Maybe my pallet for great pasta changed when I went to Italy in September? If the dishes weren't as expensive and as small as they were, maybe my rating would be better. My biggest recommendation is to relax a bit on the butter and salt. I like both items quite a bit, but a pasta dish should stand out for what is in the pasta and the pasta itself and not about the butter that it comes covered in.\nThis is a game-changing modern Italian restaurant we\u2019ll know for its pasta dishes, and is a staple to the riverside Williamsburg community. From the polite service, tasty wines, mouth watering dishes, Misi deserves Michelin status, minus the foam. Will definitely be back.\nHad a lovely lunch experience. The food was so yummy and the service was really good. The trumpet mushroom, occhi, spinach tortellini, and pista gelato are incredible!!\nUnderwhelming to be honest.

We ended up getting a seat at the counter which didn\u2019t feel too crowded but not a lot of space for belongings. It was nice to get a view of the cooks preparing everything in the kitchen. All staff were attentive and friendly, as well as helpful with recommendations. The food here was great, with fresh and quality ingredients. We started with the \u201croasted trumpet mushrooms sott'ollio, whipped ricotta crostini\u201d to share and enjoyed it. For mains we had the \u201cfettuccine, buffalo butter, parmigiano extra vecchio, black pepper\u201d and the \u201cspinach and mascarpone filled tortelli, brown butter, ricotta salata.\u201d Both pasta dishes were very rich and delicious. We left feeling full but not overly stuffed.\nThe swiss chard, broccoli rabe, and spinach tortelli is a must try.\nMisi was a really special restaurant. The welcoming staff was not the most helpful especially since we got to our reservation on time but our table was not yet ready. Once we made it to our seats the experience was amazing! Pasta was delicious and it was obvious that the cooks were masters of their craft.\nThe service was great, and our waiter was very nice as a preliminary matter. The food was awful. There was wayyyy too much salt on my pasta and barely any sauce. The other dishes were flavorless. The ricotta toast was honestly kind of gross since the ricotta was flavorless but there was so much of it, though the bread was good when we scraped the ricotta off. The fennel appetizer was alright, the best thing we had, but not worth going for alone. I couldn\u2019t be more disappointed, I feel like it was definitely a waste of money and a waste of a trip to Brooklyn. Also, not sure, but the pasta didn\u2019t taste fresh (the rigatoni at least). We were all super hungry, so it may have been worse in reality than I\u2019m describing it because it wasn\u2019t a high bar.\nVery warm and attentive staff who make you feel welcomed and appreciated. The menu is small and thoughtful \u2014 perfect place to share a few dishes with a friend -- order the fettuccini.\n\"It was so delicious!!!!\nIt was my first time in this restaurant and now it is one of my favorites !!!!!!\nSeems cool waiters and incredible food.\"\nFood was great, but not overwhelming.\nI\u2026\u2026.

Just set up the date and come here.\nTough to get a reservation but when you do, it's well worth it. Misi serves delicious, fresh pasta, some of the best I've had in New york. The ambience is beautiful and a great place to go on a date.\nHeard from a few people it was very good but honestly I think it's over hyped. The two pasta dishes were very salty. Overall it wasn't a bad experience but did not meet expectations. It still left me curious enough to come back and try the spinach and mascarpone pasta. The best parts of the meal: the barlotti beans appetizer, the barolo, Gravner grappa ( I didn't even know they made grappa) the worst parts were the extremely oversalted red pastas, too heavy on the balsamic broccoli and that the manager came to check on us, not to see how things were but to rush us out to make room for the next table after spending $400 for two people.\nFantastic food, friendly and helpful service. Worth the wait and the price for sure.\nThe place to be for a bowl of your favorite pasta.\nSome of the best modern Italian food in Brooklyn. Do not skip on the gelato or the ricotta toast.\nI loved it! The staff is super polite and friendly, food was tasty and comforting. Rich creamy gelato, def would go back\n\"Our experience at Misi did not disappoint - great service and even better food.\n\nThe mushroom and ricotta crostini was delicious and we were pleasantly surprised by the highly-recommended leeks, which were tangy and bright. The spinach and mascarpone filled tortelli was our favorite dish hands down - it melts in your mouth and the brown butter sauce is divine. The olive oil and chocolate gelato were also exceptional.\n\nWe're already planning our next dinner at Misi and can't wait!\"\n\"Managed to snag a much coveted reservation at Misi for lunch. Totally worth the 50 minute train ride for me.\n\nStarted off by ordering the Negroni Sour as my cocktail of choice while I pondered and perused the menu. I finally decided on their famous Whipped Ricotta Crostini (why wouldn't I), Sheep's Milk Occhi, Braised Lamb Chitarra, and finished off with the Pistachio Gelato and Sfumato Amari for dessert.\n\n- Whipped Ricotta Crostini w/ the roasted mushrooms was totally worth the hype. The roasted mushrooms with rosemary and the buttery crostini topped with the Whipped ricotta were an explosion of flavor in your mouth. Truly hard to otherwise describe it\n- Sheep's Milk Occhi was definitely my second favorite dish. The aesthetic of the dish itself was something to marvel at. Buttery, savory, and deceptively filling - this was a perfect dish\n- Braised Lamb Chitarra. While I enjoyed this dish, I can't say that it blew me away. I thought it was a solid, but not an exceptional dish.\n- Not too much to elaborate on with the pistachio gelato. It was a solid dessert and paired with the Sfumato it was very nice.\n\nOverall, I was impressed with Misi.

Every detail is incredible-starting from the beautiful windows to the Le Labo soap and lotion in the bathroom. We had the winter citrus salad, butter beans, fettuccine, rigatoni, and hazelnut gelato. Everything was incredible. We skipped the ricotta toast since we had it last time but it was so fun to sit at the kitchen counter and watch the chefs in action. My only request is that Misi gets stools with backs! We are too old to sit on the stools for a hour plus comfortably \ud83d\ude06\nGood-feel, clean Italian restaurant in Williamsburg. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is amazing. Has the feel of a Bib Gourmand - don\u2019t know if it is one or not, but with the scarcity of getting a reservation maybe they can\u2019t get in a review yet. The Ricotta Toast accompanied with the Mushrooms drenched in olive oil is definitely worth it. Great for a date night or an elevated meal with friends/family. Recommend trying.\n\"Sunday lunch at Misi was fantastic. This was my second visit. I had been here when the restaurant first opened and preferred Lila but now I am actually leaning toward Misi as my fave.\n\nService was on point. We sat at the kitchen counter and watched the theater. It\u2019s a great seat and I enjoyed watching the precision at work.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  We ordered items on the heavy side and it was way too much but we managed to eat it all and roll out.\n\nThe restaurant is vegetarian friendly. Lots of plant forward dishes and you have to go out of your way to order meat.\n\nWe ordered\n- slow cooked butter beans\n- trumpet mushrooms with whipped ricotta crostini\n- Spinach and mascarpone tortelli in brown butter\n- linguine with anchovy\n\nEvery bite was fantastic and the portions were generous and decedent.  The caramelization the the brown butter with the tortelli lead to nutty and sweet buttery flavor.\"\nReally like it. The ricotta toast and mushrooms are great but I loved the leek and pistachio appetizer. Gnocchi was not worth ordering but the spinach and ricotta tortellini is incredible. For dessert I recommend the olive oil ice cream\n\"follow me on instagram for local reviews! @foodasweare\n\nSure, Misi is undoubtedly known as a pasta restaurant (and a damn good one for that matter).

It may have been the most mouthwatering bite of the meal. My political food stance? Make vegetables sexy again.\n\nYes- still get the viral whipped ricotta toast, as many pastas as your friends allow, and finish with the pistachio gelato. But do yourself a favor: pay special attention to the vegetables which will arguably be the most tantalizing part of your meal.\"\nRicotta bread dish is definitely the best and worth visiting for. Not really sure if the mushrooms go well with the bread, though. The sheep milk ravioloi was thinner than what I thought, I was imagining more like knnochi but still good. I might try different pastas other than the spicy tomato one if I come back. Nice vibe with good pasta!\nAmazing! Loved everything we ordered. Definitely a top Italian restaurant in NYC.\nNice and cozy place! Food is delicious! Don't be late though! Worth to visit!\n\"Crostinis were good with the trumpet mushrooms!\n\nFilled pastas are their speciality but my favorite was the braised lamb. Out of the two filled pastas they had, the mascarpone and spinach one was better in my opinion.\"\n\"Misi was pretty fantastic overall, and I think the current rating of 4.4 on Google is fairly accurate. Entering the restaurant, ambiance is great and service was attentive, we were seated quite quickly at the bar after checking in.\n\nIn terms of food:\n\n1) the tortellini we had was very good, flavors were great and texture of the pasta was very very good, no complaints, 10/10\n\n2) the fettuccine was also very good, flavors were great, and the texture of the pasta was amazing. I've never had fettuccine that thin and silky soft. I will say that I wish it were around 20-30% less salty. It was definitely a bit harder to eat continuously because of the amount of salt seasoned (or was it all due to the parmagiano cheese?). But damn, I would still order this again. 9/10\n\n3) the bucatini, similar to the fettuccine was very good in texture and flavor, but it was also a LOT spicier than I expected, which made it difficult to eat all in one go. I'm usually ok with mild-medium spice and this was just bordering on the edge of medium to hot spiciness for me. It's odd that it's also not listed on the menu that it's spicy. 7/10\n\nOverall, Misi was fantastic for the price and I would definitely go again. I would recommend Misi to other people, just that I'd warn them about the seasoning and spices.\"\nThe food is amazing here and the service is one of a kind.
