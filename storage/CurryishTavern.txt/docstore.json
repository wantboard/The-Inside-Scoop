Service was good but 2 of our dishes had a strands of hair. The guy had an indifferent attitude towards it and was unapologetic, saying even we don\\'92t know where did it come from.

And the service was 5 star!\n\\\n\"I visited this restaurant a month ago to celebrate my birthday, and unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst decision I've made. Let me provide some details to elaborate on my experience.\\\n\\\nFor our meal, we ordered Cheese Curds Samosa Turnovers, Vegetable Pakora, and Aloo Gnocchi with Roasted Cauliflower Curry. As for drinks, we opted for Kendall's Gimlet and Raspberry Boom.\\\n\\\nThe Cheese Curds Samosa Turnovers were quite average and definitely overpriced.\\\n\\\nThe Vegetable Pakora was a disappointment as it was burnt and tasteless. We had to return it once, but the second serving was also burnt. When we brought this to the server's attention, he displayed indifference and even made a face at us, which was unprofessional.\\\n\\\nThe Aloo Gnocchi with Roasted Cauliflower Curry was the breaking point. The food served was excessively salty and diluted with water. We couldn't consume it and returned the dish. The server's response was dismissive and he seemed uninterested in addressing our concerns.\\\n\\\nNeedless to say, we left the restaurant hungry, disappointed, and vowed never to return.\\\n\\\nFurthermore, both the drinks we ordered were outrageously overpriced considering their quality.\\\n\\\nThis restaurant comes across as pretentious, lacking in quality, and excessively expensive. There is nothing modern or authentically Indian about this establishment.\\\n\\\nIn summary, this restaurant appears to be an ambitious project that suffers from terrible execution.\"\n\\\nWe were lucky to go to Curryish for a rare, leisurely mid-week lunch.

The portions were tiny, only enough for one person. extremely salty, bland flavour, mediocre ambience, nothing justified their price. they priced their food as if it was a Michelin restaurant but without the ambience or flavour. go anywhere else for biryani in Toronto and spend half the amount ($16) or in Scarborough you can have larger portions and better flavour for less than $8. I'm all for spending money but the cost of this restaurant doesn't justify the portions, ambience, or flavour.\"\n\\\nFood is good, but the price does not reflect the quality, flavor nor service. Portion size is small and no sides are included for any dishes. Overall a mediocre experience with a hefty price tag.\n\\\nWhat an amazing find for an Indian flavor restaurant infused with unique ingredients and spices.  We had dinner at this lovely intimate spot on Queen West on a Saturday night.  There were a few tables free but they were setting up for a private event later in the evening.  Service was very prompt, attentive and friendly.  Mehir was very knowledgeable and assisted with some selections.  We started with the Hakka chicken wings and pappadum.  Both were tasty and the Pappadum was quite different  - in a good way - from the typical thin pappadum. We then had the pumpkin spiced butter chicken, lamb biryani, rice and Montreal bagel style pratha which was like naan but a hundred times better than we have ever had.  The biryani and butter chicken were truly amazing combinations of fruits and flavors with the pumpkin and pineapple additions.  We could have ordered more dishes to enjoy the multitude of flavors but we were extremely full and had a lot left over for 2 people.  The pomegranate raita on the side was also the best we have had.  Every dish was like an explosion of spice and delectable in both presentation and taste.  The cost including drinks and a dessert to go was $150 with enough left over for a full meal tomorrow.  We will definitely return and recommend this gem on Queen West.\n\\\nWe had a remarkably good dinner there on a Thursday night. The food was tremendously flavourful and nuanced.

The staff was helpful and friendly. I can't recommend this enough, go try these new flavours!\n\\\n\"We liked the concepts but Curryish's execution quality & portion sizes disappointed us each time.\\\n\\\nOrdered delivery 3 times to give them a fair try.  Each time there was really only one good dish and several mediocre or bad ones.   The duck confit with curried foie gras sauce is quite good, for example.  The molasses braised beef cheeks is not. It is overly sweet and not really spiced enough.  The portion of the signature protein was stingy in all cases except for the duck (and that is twice the price of the others).   The \"\"Heirloom Squash + Brussels Sprouts Koshimbir\"\" (salad) simply does not work as a dish. For some reason half our brunch items had it over top.  It needs more flavor, more acid, and more crunch (nuts or toasted chickpea maybe), and the squash would be much better roasted with garam masala rather than served raw and spiralized.  It bears no resemblance at all to a normal koshimbir.\\\n\\\nPlaying with creative takes on traditional dishes I can understand.  What I can't understand is why someone would be selling Indian or Indian-ish food that is lacking in the quantity and variety of spices used.  Unfortunately many of the dishes were either bland or had one-note flavors rather than a rich mixture of seasonings.\\\n\\\nThe food was also poorly packaged for delivery.  Example: crisp onion rings thrown into the sauce (soggy on arrival).  Example 2: that \"\"koshimber\"\" (COLD salad) randomly thrown on top of HOT brunch mains.\\\n\\\nI really really want to be able to recommend Curryish because they are trying creative things.  But there are several other restaurants in the area that are aiming for similar concepts and execute it vastly better (Pukka, for example). Hopefully they will be able to refine their dishes and deliver on the potential.\"\n\\\nVisited Curryish over the weekend with a group of friends and was blown away by the flavour and creativity of their dishes! I tend to avoid spicy cuisines, and was worried that the food here would be too spicy for my taste but the majority of the dishes we had were very mild. The staff were also amazingly friendly and attentive and had great recommendations for our table. Will be back again for sure!\n\\\n\"The ingredient combos are eclectic.

As you are reading the menu you think to yourself \\'93how can these combinations work together?\\'94 The chef has managed to keep the integrity of each dish while giving it an unexpected twist. You can taste each element and it takes you on a flavor journey of the inspiration for each dish. The plating of each dish is a work of art and absolutely Instagram-worthy! The portions were just enough and the taste of each dish was absolutely delicious! Each bite you took you couldn\\'92t help but close your eyes and savor the moment. This restaurant is an homage to the regional foods of India (and not just North India!) while making use of local Ontario ingredients. The food is akin to your Indian grandmother\\'92s cooking if she received the best European training. In terms of price, it is slightly expensive for some people, however it is ABSOLUTELY worth it! Must try restaurant and will go again!\n\\\nDisappointing experience. Food was overpriced and wait-staff were not attentive whatsoever. Silverware and cups were also dirty.  Would not recommend.\n\\\nSpectacular, innovative, really special dishes from start to finish. This place was next level. Everything we ate was memorable and executed artfully. Cocktails were also standout. Service was warm, helpful, and unpretentious. We didn\\'92t feel rushed but they were always paying attention. It was a lovely dinner and we will be back for sure.\n\\\nAbsolutely creative and delicious food options, the service was excellent. Shlok was amazing and created a very fun atmosphere. My favorite was the Coconut upma fries ! Delicious and honestly very fun take on upma . The owner greeted us and was very friendly ! Overall amazing experience, must try !\n\\\nIn the name of fusion, I felt like some of the core flavours of the Indian dishes were taken out. The whole experience was quite average. Not up to par with the pricing or the build up to the experience itself. Average ambiance. The pricing compared to the portion size threw me off.\n\\\nWe visited the restaurant for their 3 course meal dinner on New years eve. The food was quite innovative and tasty, creative techniques and twists in dishes without floating too far away from core Indian flavors.

The mushroom veggie dish, wow. The butter chicken was spicy but not hot and tasty.\"\n\\\n\"[EDITED] This place is not worth it. It\\'92s marked up food that has small portions and is the same food you could get at any other Indian food restaurant in the city, and I've tried many. They sprung a charge on us at the bill for WATER and a 1/4 lemon claiming that \\'93it takes additional water to wash the cup therefore we charge\\'94. Other reviews say the same. In fact, the cups we received all had dirty markings on them.\\\n\\\nWhen it came time to pay, the server pre selected a $40 tip (while holding my credit card) for himself without letting me choose beforehand. I had to demand my card and the machine back so that I could have control before he paid on my behalf. The act made me reduce my tip in addition to the poor service. I wanted to try a new place with my family but we were extremely disappointed and we will not be coming back.\"\n\\\n\"The food was exceptional. I've eaten Indian food on three different continents and thousands of meals, but the fusion, the technical ability displayed by the team here was something to write home about. The unique curry in every dish gives everything a twist and the hospitality of the team is welcoming. The duck and branzino were my favourites and I really enjoyed the chocolate cake.\\\n\\\nThis is high-end Indian eating at it's finest.\\\n\\\nBest advice: Bring 3-4 friends, order about 8-10 or so dishes and just share everything.\"\n\\\nOverall a great experience, unique menu items and the chef owner is a fantastic individual.

I live in NYC and this restaurant truly compares to the best that I find there. Thank you Chef for a wonderful meal!\n\\\nWhat a gem! Toronto has so many excellent restaurants and Curryish is my new favorite.  Excellent blend of flavours that were a surprise for each dish.  The team pushes ingredients, sauces and flavors to such new heights.    The service was superb.  I felt very special and we learned so much about the approach.   This is what dinning experience can be.  Again we felt so special and thanks.\n\\\nThis is the menu that I have been searching for my whole life. When I opened the menu I literally wanted to eat the whole menu. The balance of spice in each dish ls masterful. Each version of familiar dishes was the best tasting version we had ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!!!\n\\\nWent here for dinner last night and it did not disappoint! The chef guided us through the menu and help us make a selection that really rounded out the meal. The menu is creative and everything was outstanding. My recommendation is try as much as you can and definitely get the duck!

And our server was lovely and very knowledgable about our gluten-free questions + requests. Heaven!\"\n\\\nI love this restaurant - from the service to food. They execute every dish very well. I normally not really into Indian food as I find them too oily for my taste but this one is not. They use traditional method to cook but with a twist to it which I love so much. I definitely would come back for more and would recommend to everyone.\n\\\nFood was awesome. Drinks were awesome. Staff were wonderful. Great place. Highly recommend you try it for yourself.

The owner was incredibly friendly, helping his wait staff and talking to all the customers. The service was great, the atmosphere was enjoyable, and the food was delicious. The combination of Indian cuisine with elements of other modern dishes gave everything we tried a unique flair. Our stand out dishes were the mirch maple glazed pork belly appetizer (which we got as our desert!) and the Aloo gnocchi/roasted cauliflower curry main, but the Montreal style paratha, chicken wings, and lamb/pineapple upside-down Briyani were all great as well. The price for the quantity of food was a bit high, but the experience was amazing nonetheless. Would definitely recommend.\n\\\nFood was incredible! Plate sizes could have been a little bigger for the price, but the quality of food/service was outstanding.\n\\\nThe duck confit was good but the truffle paneer kofta was ok at best. Ghee Roomali was literally just ghee/butter. The service was bad. 3 different people came and asked us for our orders. Service was all over the place.\n\\\nOverall, enjoyed the experience. Being a tavern, I'd love for them to focus on their range of cocktails and appetizers instead of full meals! Recommend the scallop and vada dishes.\n\\\nFood was good but not perfect. We had hakka wings which were good. The duck confit and bagel paratha were excellent. What missed the mark for me were the kofta, the roomali roti (it was too buttery) and the raspberry mango drink. Also the service was staggeringly slow and different people would tend to our table at different times for greeting us, drinks and even food. It felt like our server was also exhausted. Good place overall but would i go back for the price? Likely not.\n\\\nLove this place so much. It\\'92s been a while that I have been searching for a restaurant with food that surprises me with their dishes. I loved every single course we ordered and the staff is friendly with top notch service. Will definitely come back again.\n\\\n\"Oh so delicious.\\\nThis was such an amazing food experience.\\\nUsing a blend of traditional Indian spices and styles of preparation with locally sourced and seasonal ingredients, the flavours surprise and delight!\\\nA bold menu without any regret or apology.\"\n\\\nThey have quite a large menu so it\\'92s a bit difficult reviewing this place based on one visit. It\\'92s also expensive-ish and so not easy to try all the dishes on the menu without breaking the bank. Appies we had (samosa turnover and pani puri) were ok. The samosas were more of a Jamaican patty than a samosa which is probably what they intended. The pani puri was \\'85 pani puri. Main dishes (Goan chorizo and cheek curry) were fantastic and the bread was great as well. It\\'92s just difficult to rate this place higher when there are Indian restaurants in the city making equally good or better Indian food for 1/4 of the price.

So below you'll find my 5 star review from a year ago and I want you to know that the stars haven't changed a bit since Chef Miheer found himself a bricks and mortar restaurant on Queen St. The dine-in menu is wonderfully complex and flavourful and inventive. But I wanted to write today because we have just been thrilled with the return of the meal kits. We purchased two for our Thanksgiving feast (I've been making the same old turkey for, literally, decades and was so happy to be able to shake that up.) And I have to tell you the meal was beyond superb, beyond even our high expectations. The mirch marinated pear and  moong dal salad was to die for --so many different flavours and textures that came together in perfect mouthfuls. The charred eggplant bharta was brilliantly paired with pomegranate seeds. The main event -- the turkey with the pumpkin curry was inspired for Thanksgiving. In fact the entire meal was a huge success -- not to speak of massive. Because there were many more dishes -- all quite special -- but not enough space to write about.\\\nWe feel VERY thankful for that 2022 Thanksgiving dinner..\\\n\\\nReview from 2021:\\\nWe took the plunge after having read the Toronto Star article on Curryish and ordered the tasting menu  -- and are we ever glad we did! I was tempted simply on reading the menu -- but who could know how spectacular the meal would be? The chicken curry, basmati rice, and  naan were all dishes within my experience -- but they were far more deftly and aromatically prepared than any version I had previously eaten. And what a delightful surprise the \"\"Chilli Marinated Baked Sweet Potato Salad\"\" turned out to be. I had idly anticipated a salad as in a standard potato salad or garden salad. But no, this was composed of delicious and tender roasted hunks of sweet potato served with the most delectable chutney, cilantro and pomegranate seeds. I've never tasted anything like it, but hope to again soon. The \"\"Red Lentils + Celery Roots Sabji\"\" was an equal eye opener -- absolutely delicious -- even to a husband who resists lentils at the best of times.  As for the delivery, packaging, and cooking instructions -- brilliant! The fixings arrived at noon all carefully packaged and labelled. The menu was nicely presented. And the instructions were clear and uncomplicated. Altogether an excellent meal. Highly recommend!\"\n\\\nthe food is fantastic, the attention is very special, I felt like at home\n\\\nThe best mix of Canadian products and Indian flavors\n\\\nOrdered the takeaway Thanksgiving menu and it was just divine!

Highly recommended!\n\\\nsuch a wonderful culinary experience - there is so much effort and intent put into every dish.\n\\\n\"What an experience!\\\nThe host to the food.. everything was so well thought out\\\n\\\nThis place has taken innovation and Indian food hand in hand and created masterful dishes like bhunna lamb burger, pani puri tartar and aloo gnocchi.

We ordered a Montreal Bagel Parantha, Roomali Roti, Ghavan in breads, Paneer Kofta and Dal Makhani in main course. I must say each of these preparations had us wanting for more. I also liked the fact that despite being a busy weekend evening, the staff was very friendly and patient.\n\\\nEvery item on the menu is so unique and each delicious.

We felt that he forced my friend to get another beer and then brought me a different wine than what I ordered (after a long wait). He acknowledged that he changed my wine and began to pour without even checking if I was okay with that. It made me feel like he wasn\\'92t willing to open a new bottle of what I was having already.\\\n\\\nI hope that they can maybe fix these issues as they are a new restaurant.  I may try them again in a few months as the food was interesting.  I really liked the grilled octopus.\"\n\\\n\"Great ambience and friendly staff!

We were also being constantly questioned by the server on our choice and quantity of food and drinks which we didn\\'92t enjoy. Over all it was a good experience trying Indian fusion.\n\\\nI wouldn't recommend this place, it's definitely Instagram worthy, and that's pretty much it. Super expensive, 39 dollars for a small duck leg. Pineapple stir fried rice is very salty. Long story short, food presentation is amazing, taste is decent for most of the item. However, small portion and expensive\n\\\n\"Curryish is something special.\\\n\\\nThe chef is able to create an inventive, tasty experience that still manages to feel authentically South Asian.\\\n\\\nFantastic experience, great food, and matching service.\\\n\\\nWe'll definitely be back.\"\n\\\nExotic and really tasty brunch. Green asparagus and zucchini pakoras, and Maharaja breakfast; lamb sausage, eggs, chickpea masala, garlic roti. Nice micro beers on tap. I wish there was a sixth star\\'85. Will be back very soon.\n\\\nWowza!    Everything I wanted and nothing I expected!   Food, owner, server and bartender\\'85.AMAZING!!!!\n\\\nThis place is AMAZING. We ordered the samosas, lamb biryani, heirloom tomato salad and special of the day. Everything was delicious and the tamarind chutney is an absolute must. The service was impeccable and the staff were friendly and proud of their restaurant. Will definitely come here again!\n\\\nFood and service was amazing. You feel immediately at home by the way they treat you. 10/10 would come again!\n\\\nI dined at Curryish last night with my husband. The menu was well thought out and unique. The portions are quite big and delicious. My favourite was the Coconut Pudding with peach jam. My only critique was that the light fixture over the table we were sitting at was quite low (husband is tall and hit his head a few times) and flickered frequently. We sat at the back near the kitchen.\n\\\nWe ordered Curryish when it was a pop-up delivery project during the pandemic and it was amazing! So we were eager to visit the restaurant, and it did not disappoint. The dishes were all delicious and inventive. The poppadum is deceptively simple and was a standout dish! We can\\'92t wait to eat here again.}", "doc_id": "4c888960-a823-4fda-baa3-78c96ce254d7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e3eb41217cd77a2cf991d280915e388ab57455276eaef9f5b2c672a5bbacfaa8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 43873, "end": 47295}, "relationships": {"1": "a9855c59-6ccd-45ad-9206-52717a190d50", "2": "430c4ce4-3f8e-4d83-b95f-59da479be4d1"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
