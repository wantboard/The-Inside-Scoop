To begin with, being a beer lover, I was recommended two of the most expensive beers on the menu, retailing at $72 and $69 a bottle, an amount which I believe is staggering for one beer, while I could have been offered another something more reasonable. I felt a bit scammed. As for the food, I enjoyed the scallop starter and the chocolate tart. As for the rest, one word aptly describes my experience \u201cimbalance\u201d. Precisely the balance of flavors was badly dosed. A fish that was far too sweet, the chicken which was supposedly marinated for three days was more than disappointing and bland. The plates did not have a presentation worthy of the price they were worth. It's easy to find much better elsewhere.

The dishes are good, well cooked, for the most part but nothing exceptional, but there is a problem for some. Example: $20 knives. It's literally two knives. A knife is roughly the equivalent of a mussel. It is as if we had been served 2 mussels. And it's not by drowning it with elderberry and asparagus that it's better to pass the pill. Never seen that in my life, don't mess around.\nThe chicken, absolutely delicious, perfectly mastered cooking. But I find hair there, says it at the end nicely without having said anything during the meal (just to enjoy what). No reaction.\nThe wine now, we let ourselves be carried away and had a glass served without being given the price beforehand (again great atmosphere, the waiters are cool, we let ourselves go) which was not bad but clearly without more. $17. Glass. Bottles start at 70, which is correct, but after dropping $40 for 2 glasses, we stop there. It was good, the cooks know what they are doing, but it lacks generosity and honestly nothing exceptional in terms of flavor \u2026 I never complain about the quantities, as a cook I know that good products are expensive and the talent of the cooks is paid for. But this is supposed to be a wine bistro guys, not Le Meurice. Conclusion: $200 for 5 courses (starters, the terms must be said), and two glasses of wine. It's more expensive than Damascus \ud83d\ude2c Overall quite disappointed.\n\n(Original)\nTres jolie restaurant avec un service vraiment sympathique.

Clearly there is a poor management of tables and customers, and although I understand that issues may arise and no one is perfect, what really upset me was the fact that not even once there was anyone from their staff checking the door or giving any explanations or apologies to us. We literally had to wait for almost one hour in line, outside, on a rainy evening, until someone showed up. Again, no apologies for messing up with our (and everybody else\u2019s) reservations, nor they even brought us to our table: instead, they said that the only availability they had was outside in the terrace. I said I wouldn\u2019t want to be sitting at the terrace because firstly it was raining, and secondly, I had placed a reservation explicitly for an indoor table. Then they simply let us wait even more outside until a table inside was available, after a total of one hour and forty minutes delay from our original reservation time. Food was okay and honestly I couldn\u2019t appreciate the experience anymore given how upset and disappointed I was.
