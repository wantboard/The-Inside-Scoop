Can't wait to go back for dinner.\"\n\\\n\"Excellent appetizers and desserts, pretty good mains, amazing service.\\\n\\\nStopped by for dinner and got:\\\n- Housebread: If you've been to any Alo restaurant, you know this is a must. Best bread in the city.\\\n- Beef Carpaccio: This appetizer was the standout dish of the night. Melt-in-your-mouth slivers of beef that were mindblowingly tasty with the chive, aioli and mustard seed.\\\n- Baked Clams: Clams with brown butter, nudja, lemon, croutons. Sounded tastier than it did. Small portion size for the price.\\\n- Yellowfin Tuna: Good cook, good quality. The sauce on top was tasty though a bit overpowering.\\\n- Braised Short Rib: Good quality, really tender. Though taste wasn't differentiated.\\\n- Coconut Cream Pie: Simply put, best coconut cream pie in the city. The macaroon crust is divine.\\\n- Opera Cake: Nice and spongey, would've liked a darker chocolate taste.\\\n\\\nService was amazing: great advice, really attentive, prompt with refilling (water and even the lemon we asked for the water). Kitchen was quick for a place like this. Space is beautiful. Reservations recommended for peak periods as it gets packed.\"\n\\\nAtmosphere, service and food were all fantastic.  Definitely going back and will checked out the lobby bar upstairs for drinks before dinner.\n\\\nAbsolutely loved it! Much more approachable than Alo and super tasty!!!!!\n\\\nI really enjoyed the ambience and decor of this hotel.

Very rich with no where to go for relief (your protein will come with literally nothing else but sauce). Left a lot to be desired. We ordered the chicken, beef spare ribs, sea bream, cauliflower and shishito peppers. The best thing was the cauliflower which saying A LOT after spending $500, we sent back the peppers since they were burned and shrivelled into nothing. Our server didn't fight us on it and took it off the bill.\\\n\\\nWe asked for the sea bream to be wrapped up and we were told \"\"your fish will be over there for you!\"\" and pointed to the coat check? and when we finally left, no one gave us the fish and we left without it, since it slipped our minds to pick up our food with our coats. Very odd.\\\n\\\nWould I go back? Unfortunately probably not, even though I would have love to take other friends and family just to see the restaurant itself and the open concept kitchen.\"\n\\\nSuch a lovely atmosphere and great staff.

The service was friendly, the food was memorable, and seeing the chefs through the open kitchen added onto the experience. We really enjoyed the hamachi crudo, grilled sea bream and the beef carpaccio. A little disappointed with the baked clams - a bit too chewy. Their coconut dessert was perfect if you have a sweet tooth.\\\nHighly recommend for a lovely evening out and if you're okay with a high price point.\"\n\\\nvery nice place with a great vibe! the bread is the same they serve at Alo, so fluffy and delicious. highly recommend the grilled octopus. none of the appetizers were particularly compelling, but everything we had was pretty good. upscale but not too uptight.\n\\\nGreat venue.

I brought my cousin this time with me to try this place out. I\\'92ve always been out of luck when it comes to reservations as it\\'92s either way too early for dinner or way too late. Luckily I snagged a spot for 6:15pm.\\\n\\\nWe ordered the potato flat bread, beef carpaccio, short rib , half chicken and fried spinach.\\\n\\\nThe flat bread and beef carpaccio was really good and I highly recommended trying it. I would say the potato flatbread is a little touch to chew( warning here)  otherwise its delicious.\\\n\\\nThe mains- the short rib was really good. The flavour and the taste was perfect. I tried my cousins chicken dinner and it was really good as well and chicken was not dry at all.\\\n\\\nLastly, we had the drinks called good vibes only, recommended by our server which was 0% alcohol as we had to drive back uptown. It was delicious, it was like a pineapples flavour with 0%  tequila? drink with some  a bit of salt. Highly recommended that drink for nonalcoholic foodies!\"\n\\\nThe sea bream and a couple of cocktails were pretty decent. And the bread and butter was similar to the one in Aloette but it was good too.\n\\\nKatherine was awesome. Great understanding of the menu. Paired our food well wine pairings and was very knowledgeable able the restaurant dishes and inspirations. We will be back!!\n\\\nGreat service! Only stopped in for drinks so will be back!\n\\\nOverall it was okay. The selection of sides was lacking as if bread and fries was the only carb options, but the food quality and service was good. The beef short ribs stood out, very tender\n\\\nThe appetizers and desserts were to die for. The mains, I had the grilled octopus and my wife had the chicken were good but nothing to write home about but the overall experience made up for it. Try and find a table that overlooks the kitchen, it's a fun experience to see them in action.\n\\\nWe had a amazing experience at Alder! We were celebrating a friends birthday and the vibe of the location was perfect for it. Our waiter, Garett, was phenomenal, just a pleasure to be around. He recommended the best dishes that paired really well together - he definitely has amazing taste! 5/5 recommend for a night out!\n\\\n\"Located in the beautiful Ace hotel, Alder definitely has a charming dining environment.

The Carpaccio is both creative and delicious while the Octopus is simply the best grilled Octopus I ever had.\\\nHowever the \\'93Sucking Pig\\'94 and Hamachi, in my opinion, can be done better.

The chefs have a real talent for combining unexpected flavours and textures in a way that is both innovative and delicious for some dishes with the use of their open woodfired grill right in the middle of the kitchen. Every dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour, making it clear that much thought and care had gone into every aspect of the meal.\\\n\\\nThis location was the home for Reactor Art & Design back in the 80s, one of the best design houses at the time. Now completely rebuilt and it is now the Ace Hotel Toronto, Alder is on the lower level. The decor is stylish and modern, surrounded by concrete, wood and custom-designed copper lanterns, that feels welcoming and comfortable. The restaurant has a warm and relaxed vibe, with a cozy and intimate open dining room that makes it the perfect spot for a romantic dinner or a special occasion.\\\n\\\nOur server Chris was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

The interior design is stunning, and even though it's industrial with raw concrete and exposed infrastructure, it feels welcoming and comfortable. The food was fantastic and prepared expertly.\n\\\nOne of the best restaurants to open in the past year. Food is a 10/10\n\\\nReally awesome vibes, reminds me of places I'd go to for casual drinks and chats in NYC.

Lovely service as expected, and great decor.\n\\\n\"Our experience at Alder was great - the food was so so good and the service was great. I'm honestly surprised it's not getting more buzz.  I'm looking forward to returning.\\\n\\\nThat being said, it wasn't a full 5 stars because the bathrooms were not well maintained (out of TP, paper towels etc.), and initially we were seated at the bottom of the stairs which was cold and very busy with through traffic - it really didn't feel like a table for 2 should have been floating there at all. The hostess was very kind about moving us when we asked her right away, and I'm so glad because I wouldn't have enjoyed myself there at all. Also the cocktails we ordered were very average - too bad!\"\n\\\nGreat atmosphere and ambiance to the restaurant. We had a good time and they were very accommodating and attentive when it comes to gluten allergies.

Absolutely incredible. Our waiter was very thoughtful and fun, providing us with a lot of guidance on the menu. I could not be more pleased.

Highlights included the beef carpaccio appetizer, octopus, grilled chicken and short rib. Service was a little slow but overall a great experience.

Alder is like nothing else I\\'92ve experienced in Toronto.\n\\\nCocktails took over 15 minutes to be served every time we ordered them. The food was okay nothing memorable, over priced for quality. We ordered the steak, octopus, carpaccio, burrata, and tuna.\n\\\nHave been to Alder twice. Both times the service was exceptional. Ambiance and energy were terrific. Food was outstanding. Maybe add a few vegan or vegetarian options. Wasn't sure about the eggplant potato flatbread. But overall, everything was delicious. So well run for a new restaurant, front and back of house. Ace lobby bar upstairs is awesome too. Nice vibe and friendly sophisticated service.\n\\\nHad a wonderful dinner at this restaurant. The food presentation was fairly simple but the taste was the real winner, no need for overly complex looking dishes. Highly recommend the fish for main and the coconut pie for dessert.\n\\\nAmazing food, drinks, ambiance and service! Dave was our waiter and he was ACES!\n\\\nDined at Alder last night as a party of 3 and had an exceptional experience. Great atmosphere and felt taken care of from the beginning where we checked our coats and were taken to a seating area to wait for our table. Our server Garret? (male server with nose piercing) was very friendly, provided amazing service, and was very attentive without being pushy. We went with many of his recommendations such as the City cabin which was a perfect cocktail to start (and end with), the sea bream crudo, endive salad and braised short ribs which were all great choices as well.

The baked clams were out of this world, so was the cucumber salad!  Highly recommend..but you need to book way ahead.  Warning: the music gets louder by 8:30, so book early if you don\\'92t want the \\'93bar\\'94 atmosphere.\n\\\n\"I visited Alder for my birthday on a Tuesday with a 5:30 reservation. The food and service were overall pretty good. I\\'92m mostly giving 3 stars because of where we were seated (see photo). I\\'92m honestly not sure why guests are even seated in this location because it took so much away from the dining experience.\\\n\\\nWe were seated in a literal tiny corner next to the hallway leading to the washroom, across from the server station, and next to the bar. There was also a huge concrete column behind our table that obstructed our view of half the restaurant (the nice half with the open kitchen!). I was really disappointed - it felt like we were being hidden. A large part of the dining experience is the atmosphere and views; this seating location took all of that away for me.\\\n\\\nI would recommend Alder not seat guests at those two tables and repurpose that corner for something else.\"\n\\\nUnique hotel lobby bar.  Great service and food offerings.   Limited wine choices by the glass\n\\\nI went to Alder for my birthday with my family and I had a fantastic experience. Our table was not far from the kitchen and there was such an amazing atmosphere and energy coming from the kitchen. Dave was our server and he was really knowledgeable. He gave us great recommendations for both cocktails and food. Everything we ate (and drank!) was delicious and my family was also so impressed by the quality of the food. My favourite dishes were the octopus and coconut cream pie for dessert. I will absolutely be coming back soon!\n\\\nHad a good experience and dinner at Alder. The atmosphere was great and I loved sitting near the open kitchen. The service was decent. I am a huge fan of chef Patrick Kriss\\'92s restaurants and was lucky enough to see him at Alder. We ordered the sea bream crudo (loved the sauce, it was paired very well with the fish), beef carpaccio (meet was super soft), grilled octopus (perfect texture, was my favourite dish), braised short rib (soft and tender), baked clams (juicy and sauce was good), potato flatbread (tasted good but it was slightly hard), coconut cream pie (delicious wasn\\'92t overly sweet), mille-feuille (personally was too sweet and chocolate was a bit overpowering/heavy), warm pear cake (surprisingly was my favourite dessert, warm cake with soft pears, fragrant, and outer layer was a bit crispy).

Excellent for restaurants of this price and category.\n\\\nLovely setting within the hotel. Food is great and fits the theme set by the restaurant. Favourites include the desserts and the steak.

Many of the top restaurants in Toronto and to say this is one of my favourite experiences wouldn't do this dinner justice.\\\n\\\nGeraldine (our server) expertly walked us through the menu and from the moment we had a drink (upstairs bar as we waited for our table) to begin seated - the architecture is nothing short of stunning.  Space and design matters - every detail done with intent and simplicity.\\\n\\\nThe photos will do the food its own service, but just go.  Book it now.  It's not just impeccable food and presentation, it's an energetic experience.  This will not break the bank either - which I was surprised by.  I shall return to try the few things we couldn't fit onto the table.\\\n\\\nBravo.\"\n\\\nDelicious food, great service and atmosphere.\n\\\n\"Finally got to try Alder! Our waitress was incredible , and this extends to all of the service staff. The decor is sleek, swanky and modern- really enjoyed the vibes. Had oysters to start, and the cocktail sauce (which I usually don\\'92t like) was divine! Wanted to eat it with the spoon. We also got ravioli which was delicious and the grilled sea bream. I enjoyed the flavour of the sea bream but would have liked a chase with it, some kind of green or carbohydrate to have in between bites. There are sides for this- but it would\\'92ve been nice on the plate. Potato flatbread with tomatoes and anchovy was probably my favourite!!\\\nWould perhaps go again but just to the bar, and for the flatbread!\"\n\\\n\"We had high hopes based on other Patrick Criss spots.

Drawing on elements from the wood-fired grill, we envision a little more olive oil than butter; lightly-treated seasonal vegetables; a selection of crudos, handmade pastas, and charcoal-grilled seafood and meats,\"\" says chef Patrick Kriss.

I brought my cousin this time with me to try this place out. I&#39;ve always been out of luck when it comes to reservations as it&#39;s either way too early for dinner or way too late. Luckily I snagged a spot for 6:15pm. <br><br>We ordered the potato flat bread, beef carpaccio, short rib , half chicken and fried spinach. <br><br>The flat bread and beef carpaccio was really good and I highly recommended trying it. I would say the potato flatbread is a little hard to chew( warning here) \\'a0otherwise its delicious. <br><br>The mains- the short rib was really good. The flavour and the taste was perfect. I tried my cousins chicken dinner and it was really good as well and chicken was not dry at all. <br><br>Lastly, we had the drinks called good vibes only, recommended by our server which was 0% alcohol as we had to drive back uptown.

I think I liked the menu better than Alo Bar.\n\\\nAs a huge fan of Alo and Aloette, I was super excited to try out chef Patrick&#39;s new restaurant located in the Ace Hotel. The vibe of this place is upscale casual and it&#39;s definitely a mixed crowd. I went here for a Valentine&#39;s dinner (not day of) and it was packed for a week night at 9PM. Service was a little slow initially and they were about 15-20mins behind on our reservation time and had us wait at the bar. It did pick up eventually and food arrived quite fast. Our server was friendly and made sure that water was always filled. <br><br>Onto the food, we tried a bunch of things:<br><br>-Citrus &amp; Burrata: very light and balanced flavours here, although I wish it was just a little more sour <br>-Beef Carpaccio: MUST GET! This was my favorite dish of the night and had the perfect amount of crunch from the garnishes and chewiness from the beef <br>-Octopus: perfectly cooked and a surprisingly big portion, loved the potatoes too <br>-Lamb: flavours were pretty basic but the lamb was cooked really nicely and was tender <br>-Baked clams: pretty small (4 clams) for the price but I enjoyed it, only get it if you love clams <br>-Bread &amp; Butter: nothing needs to be said about this famous bread <br>-Jangle Pop cocktail: super light and tasted great<br><br>Overall, we enjoyed the apps more than the mains but everything was definitely well-presented. Nothing really blew us away but the beef carpaccio was a highlight. Prices are generally fair and I would recommend going for the great ambiance and solid food.\n\\\nIt was ok, not worth the money.

We even noticed that the music was at the perfect volume no matter where we were despite being right in front of the speakers. Everyone was heard.

We had a large group and they were quite patient with us and made several recommendations. Everything that I tried was tasty, including their mocktail! I would definitely order the Sea Bream Crudo again, and would love to try the other dishes next time.\n\\\nHad a good experience and dinner at Alder. The atmosphere was great and I loved sitting near the open kitchen. The service was decent. I am a huge fan of chef Patrick Kriss&#39;s restaurants and was lucky enough to see him at Alder. We ordered the sea bream crudo (loved the sauce, it was paired very well with the fish), beef carpaccio (meet was super soft), grilled octopus (perfect texture, was my favourite dish), braised short rib (soft and tender), baked clams (juicy and sauce was good), potato flatbread (tasted good but it was slightly hard), coconut cream pie (delicious wasn&#39;t overly sweet), mille-feuille (personally was too sweet and chocolate was a bit overpowering/heavy), warm pear cake (surprisingly was my favourite dessert, warm cake with soft pears, fragrant, and outer layer was a bit crispy). Highly recommend coming for a delicious dinner especially on special occasions.\n\\\n4/5 <br>Good food but portion for price is low key disaster. I got oysters (I think it was 6 pieces. Unfortunately they were refreshing but pretty bland taste this time), baked clams (4 pieces, Flav remind me of American style seafood lasagna. Some clams were over cooked but tasty), potato bread( think 4 rolls, I got not much to comment. good tasty bread to clean delicious sauces from other dishes), octopus main (3 legs along with salad size diced potatoes and red peppers. Probably it&#39;s the most balanced dish out of all but to be a main, I would expect one more leg than just three legs), suckling pig (tasty but not sure how I feel about carpaccio style pork skin &amp; meat on plate. Sauce was absolutely delicious though), chocolate mille feuile (bitter semi sweet creamy dessert with perfect chrunch and salty &amp; nutty caramel sauce that will remind you of sneakers definitely made everything better. Kinda wish it was little more experimental and have little more depth to it but still pretty tasty) and little more than a bottle of wine(I will personally stick to local wines from this establishment). Feeling ok-full at the end. Service was extremely slow but they seem like they are still trying to figure out how to manage spike of customers after release of Michelin star list (this restaurant is running by same chef who received multiple 1 Michelin star) so this might be resolve later on. For two people, I will feel comfortable about ordering 3 appetizers, 2-3 mains (maybe side), desserts along with a bottle or two of wine depends on how much you guys usually drinks to feel satisfied. I will probably return to this place if all the hype dies down. Was going to give 3.7 but extra point for great hostess service.\n\\\nWhen I heard this was Patrick Kriss&#39; new", "doc_id": "227fb8f5-5da8-4083-b92d-fe1d5c0cebd4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "34bb0cf1cea18ac70e5fa29cc3362a8273bf6a7b4b1b2ba50a8523cb90bf4166", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 50510, "end": 54204}, "relationships": {"1": "c9d159c7-19da-439c-b437-a4e3ab2b99ad", "2": "92c542fe-2f4a-4536-84c8-a01a6d25b4a4", "3": "57f5a9a9-e669-4629-85d5-4056301fe519"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "57f5a9a9-e669-4629-85d5-4056301fe519": {"__data__": {"text": "tasty) and little more than a bottle of wine(I will personally stick to local wines from this establishment).

It&#39;s on the lower level of the Ace hotel, and I thought it was super cool to descend the wooden steps to the hostess stand. The service was very good - they wiped down the table frequently. My dining partner and I opted for the clams to start, and they were so flavorful! Their creamy broth was delightful as well, and I tipped the shell against my lips so I could savor it all. For the main course, we did octopus and sea bream. Both were excellent. The octopus was prepared very well, and it was a generous 3 tentacles. The sea bream skin was super crispy yet light, and the flesh below was tender and flakey. We opted for the warm fig cake for dessert, and I loved the caramelized figs on top! The cake itself was moist and not overly sweet but full of flavor. I tried the Ace martini, which I enjoyed. Overall a great experience!\n\\\nAlder, the Ace Hotel&#39;s swanky signature restaurant led by Chef Patrick Kriss, opened its doors in August. The majority of items on its Mediterranean-inspired menu are kissed by the wood-fired grill and, like Kriss&#39; other restaurants, seasonality and sourcing are of utmost importance. Alder&#39;s rotating menu will give patrons a reason to visit again and again--and admire the stunning architecture and ambiance while there.\n\\\nVery cozy spot. Dim lighting. I really enjoyed the tomato and burrata salad - extremely fresh. The tempura peppers were also so addictive. The mains were ok - had the braised beef and ravioli.

If you are familiar and have dined at his other restaurants (Alo, Aloette, Alobar), you are in for a treat as well at Alder. The restaurant space is located downstairs when you enter the hotel. The large windows and high ceilings give the space some natural light where the focal point is their open kitchen. In terms of capacity, room can accommodate up to about 60 diners or so.<br><br>Reservations were tough to book and are definitely recommended! I believe I reserved a month before my actual dining date and I went on Tues evening at around 6pm. If you&#39;re wanting a later dinner time, they definitely may have 9-9:30pm slots available if you keep checking from time to time. Either way, this restaurant is definitely popular the later it gets!<br><br>My friend and I arrived at our reserved time (6pm) and we were promptly seated and greeted. We ended up getting a nice big circular table just for the 2 of us. The server explained the menu and also went through the cocktail list with us. The menu is meant to be shared. Throughout the night service was friendly and attentive and our waiter made sure we were satisfied with our meal. The pace of the meal was also well thought out and we never felt rushed where we had time to enjoy each set of dishes that were brought out.<br><br>Cocktail wise my friend opted for an espresso martini while I opted for a cocktail called &#34;Be Like Water&#34; which consisted of Ketel One vodka with pink-peppercorn-and-verjus syrup, basil, and a mix of lime and lemon juices.<br><br>Food wise, we ordered the following items:<br>- Baked clams with crouton, brown butter, &#39;nduja, lemon<br>- Big eye tuna with charred poblano aioli, radish, pearl onion<br>- Potato flatbread (tomato &amp; white anchovy)<br>- Grilled sea bream with saffron vinaigrette, caper, cerignola olive<br>- Suckling pig with charred corn relish, watercress<br>- Coconut cream pie", "doc_id": "57b815d4-fc00-4496-bb21-ecf82234bb76", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d448a36dc54bf804df8fef5c38bc016810b89407975f259597a5c882518a82e1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 57757, "end": 61246}, "relationships": {"1": "c9d159c7-19da-439c-b437-a4e3ab2b99ad", "2": "57f5a9a9-e669-4629-85d5-4056301fe519", "3": "aa819255-51d1-4dfe-9c17-6e95e4de6b03"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa819255-51d1-4dfe-9c17-6e95e4de6b03": {"__data__": {"text": "martini while I opted for a cocktail called &#34;Be Like Water&#34; which consisted of Ketel One vodka with pink-peppercorn-and-verjus syrup, basil, and a mix of lime and lemon juices.<br><br>Food wise, we ordered the following items:<br>- Baked clams with crouton, brown butter, &#39;nduja, lemon<br>- Big eye tuna with charred poblano aioli, radish, pearl onion<br>- Potato flatbread (tomato &amp; white anchovy)<br>- Grilled sea bream with saffron vinaigrette, caper, cerignola olive<br>- Suckling pig with charred corn relish, watercress<br>- Coconut cream pie (macaroon crust, caramelized white chocolate)<br><br>Overall, food tasted great. Definitely would recommend the big eye tuna, grilled sea bream, and the coconut cream pie! The big eye tuna came carpaccio style but with thicker cuts of tuna. The aioli, radish and pearl onion added to the complex flavours of the dish but did not overpower the main star. They actually complemented the tuna very well. The grilled sea bream is a definite must get if you love fish. The way the skin of the fish was cooked was mindblowing! It was light and crisp from the char where the fish was cooked beautifully. Also, it was completely deboned as well. Lastly, you cannot finish your meal without the coconut cream pie. It was extremely light and airy with lots of coconut!<br><br>Overall, delicious food and attentive and great service. Lovely ambiance. Definitely recommend checking out Alder for a nice meal out.\n\\\nI finally had the chance to check out the new Ace Hotel and the much anticipated Alder and what a great new venue! Wow, after the @michelinguide accolades to the @alorestaurant team and @patrickkriss it&#39;s no surprise that it&#39;s such a hit already! Incredible staff and service, the ambiance is wonderful (not to mention accommodating to kids!), and the food is not only beautiful, but plentiful with large portions and delicious! Pictured here are the big eye tuna which was nicely complemented with radishes and pearl onions, and the octopus was divine! My dining companions had the short rib, potato flatbread and salmon and they all looked incredible. BTW compliments to the bar chef for the great Paloma !!! My fav!!! Ty so much! I&#39;ll be back again, and although I hope soon, these reservations are hard to get!\n\\\nDelicious food but average service experience. We were seated at the worst table and the menu was not explained to us promptly. Menu is poorly designed with some strange options for side dishes as some proteins do not come with vegetables or starch. 4 tiny clams for $20 were rubbery and overcooked.<br><br>Restaurant is on the basement level so there is no natural light.

The food came out in decent time from the kitchen and other servers checked in on us occasionally when they noticed we were looking around for ours. 4 stars only because of the slow and scarce service.\\\n\\\nBeef Carpaccio \\\nBaked Clams \\\nHeirloom Tomato & Burrata \\\nSea Bream Crudo \\\nEast Coast Oysters\\\nEndive Salad\\\nBlack Pepper Ravioli \\\nGrilled Octopus \\\nBraised Short Rib \\\nMille fuille\\\n\\\nI loved so many dishes that we ordered but the top favorites were absolutely the burrata, crudo, Carpaccio, octopus and short rib. The baked clams were very tasty but a little salty.\\\n\\\nI can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu! I think I liked the menu better than Alo Bar.More\"\n\\\n\"This restaurant is located within the Ace Hotel. The interior is influenced by the early Art-Deco style from the 1920\\'92s, which now reflects a more modern twist to the space. I liked the overall atmosphere of this restaurant. The restaurant is located on the lower...level, on the main floor is another bar area.\\\n\\\nI started with the cucumber salad ,grilled spinach, and tuna carpaccio. As mains, I tried the half grilled chicken which had great flavouring and the braised short rib. My favourites were the cucumber salad and half grilled chicken. Overall, they great flavouring!More\"\n\\\nOverall wonderful experience.  Outstanding staff:  our waiter Mark, the maitre d Jermaine, and everyone else we met.  Loved the appetizers, especially the Sea Bream Crudu.  Two excellent mains:  the ravioli and the grilled Sea Bream.  And one of the best coconut cream pies I have...ever tasted.  Great evening.More\n\\\nLoved the overall vibe of this restaurant - 70s, dark, cozy. The food is great for sharing - we had the cucumber salad, citrus burrata, ravioli (rich), shishito peppers and their epic coconut cream pie. All delicious. We sat at a round table and all...commented on how our back and legs hurt...we are not that old ha. The leather sling chairs are really terrible. Super heavy to get in and out of, and not supportive at all.More\n\\\nThe entire dining experience was beyond expectations and I can say my expectations were very high!! Food, service and design were all world class!\n\\\n\"As a fan of ALO and AloBar Yorkville, I had huge expectations of Alder, the newest member of the Alo Food Group.

Food, service and design were all world class!\n\\\n\"As a fan of ALO and AloBar Yorkville, I had huge expectations of Alder, the newest member of the Alo Food Group. The group\\'92s latest gem did not disappoint.\\\n\\\nThe restaurant was housed in the basement of the relatively new Ace Hotel. Designed by award-winning...Shim-Sutcliffe Architects, the d\\'e9cor of the restaurant is stunning!\\\n\\\nJust like other Alo restaurants, the open kitchen is the focal attraction of Alder as well. The menu wasn\\'92t comprehensive, but enough to offer something for everyone - fresh seafood, grilled chicken, braised short-rib, prime striploin,  and some exotic dishes such as the suckling pig. \\\n\\\nThe starters reminded me of what\\'92s being offered at AloBar Yorkville. We started with Heirloom Tomato and Burrata and Cucumber & Melon Salad followed by Grilled Octopus and the Suckling Pig as our entrees. They all tasted delicious and my friend was even impressed with the suckling pig as that\\'92s one of the main delicacies in Chinese food and, although made differently, it tasted equally good. \\\n\\\nOnce again, desserts looked familiar as some of them are being offered at AloBar as well. My Mille-Feuille tasted creamy and decadent while my friend\\'92s Coconut Cream Pie looked and tasted absolutely heavenly.\\\n\\\nI was particularly impressed by the customized wines (1 Chardonnay and 1 Cabernet Franc) specially made for Alder by the renowned Pearl Morissette winery in Jordan Station, Ontario. Having quite enjoyed the Chardonnay, I vowed to try the red next time.\\\n\\\nThe space of the restaurant is bigger than both ALO and AloBar but still feel intimate enough without too much noise distractions.  Service was excellent and typical of what to expect of an Alo restaurant - servers and employees were all so passionate snd happy about their jobs! \\\n\\\nWe were in the early seating, so the clientele was a good mix of young professionals, families (without kids) and dating couples. The vibe was lively and vivacious. \\\n\\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience; would highly recommend the restaurant; and will return in no time!More\"\\\n}", "doc_id": "64deccd1-35a8-4c53-99b1-442db5b35c94", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "642942d4070e32897e6d85f5d316f6913207533b3edbda2ee8bda59254316688", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 68041, "end": 70648}, "relationships": {"1": "c9d159c7-19da-439c-b437-a4e3ab2b99ad", "2": "76160dac-8dfd-4840-88fa-f5c23e049990"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
