\\cf0 Had the chance to finally check out Edulis after hearing so many amazing things about it. Took me about 2 months to secure reservation, so make sure you&#39;re on the ball with dates and times in mind once reservations open up. Any hesitation, chances are... you&#39;ll lose your spot.<br><br>The food was good, service was amazing. Our server, Philip is the best of the best. Very attentive and knowledgeable. Explained every dish and provided insight into what the chefs vision for the dish was.<br><br>The food was really good, however I have to be honest, it didn&#39;t wow us to warrant 5 stars. I&#39;d say 4.5. Seabream, Snow Crab, Scallops, Halibut Cheek and Clams, Lobster was amazing. Stuff Squid and the chicken was a miss for us, despite still being a very interesting way of using the protein. These 2 things were the only items during our experience that didn&#39;t hit the mark, other than that, it was a great meal at one of the top restaurants in Canada.\n\\\nDisappointed that such a highly rated restaurant with talented chefs refuse to handle as allergy as common as shellfish. I would think chefs are trained to handle allergies, but Edulis refuses to serve.\n\\\nHonestly such an experience. I&#39;ve personally never tried to book reservations here before, but I&#39;ve heard they go really quick. They have a release date for the upcoming month or so and you have to have reserve the date before anyone else does. Luckily, our friends were able to secure us a spot for a Friday night. <br><br>It&#39;s a very cute and intimate restaurant. I would say maybe 20-30 people could fit in here. Inside is candle lit, making it a great spot for a date (or to enjoy by yourself). They only have one seating per table per night, which is why it&#39;s probably so hard to book. It made it more special and unique because we didn&#39;t feel rushed and we could just enjoy our company, take our time eating the phenomenal food and ask whatever questions we had. The menu was also personalized with our names on it - such a nice touch!<br><br>The food itself was amazing. Each dish tasted so fresh and we loved that a lot of the seafood was sourced in Canada and the other ingredients from Ontario farms. The food was so good that it made us like and appreciate things we don&#39;t usually like (that&#39;s when you know it&#39;s really good)!<br><br>Even though the food was incredible, the star of the show for me was the bread. Oh my goodness. I probably had two whole loaves to myself, not even exaggerating. It was sooo good with the butter they had, and they just kept refilling the loaf every time we finished one. I honestly wanted to bring some home. <br><br>Price wise, it seems pricier than other restaurants but you don&#39;t tip on top. So it&#39;s pretty comparable given the quality of food and service. <br><br>Next time, we will try the lunch menu as we&#39;ve heard good things about it too, and it&#39;s supposed to be a different vibe. <br><br>Overall, this actually ties the #1 spot for us for", "doc_id": "1066c179-8162-4346-8443-0c0ded03ddef", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "73860a3c7eaf6754702fb9c9d4749aea737d0084d30225ffeefce8fef6b8b62a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3381}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "3": "4c731964-ab41-4c94-94e5-7c533e3e1506"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c731964-ab41-4c94-94e5-7c533e3e1506": {"__data__": {"text": "really good)!<br><br>Even though the food was incredible, the star of the show for me was the bread.

That&#39;s right, my fellow slow eaters can savour their meal in peace. They want you to stay awhile and enjoy the meal (and the company of your dining companion!)<br><br>Now, on to the food. Oh my goodness. If this restaurant doesn&#39;t get at least one Michelin star, it will be a crime. And we Canadians should take it as a personal offense. <br><br>The 7-course tasting menu featured seafood from all across Canada. We had fish from both coasts, as well as Nunavut. We also had caviar, crab, and lobster. The pairings were savoury and divine. My favourite dish featured fresh little mushrooms from Saskatchewan (picked at the beginning of the season), and sweet corn (from Ontario, I believe). <br><br>Every course is so deliberate, both in flavour and in presentation. No detail spared. I almost feel sorry for eating it. <br><br>We added two additional dishes to our very filling tasting courses: aged cured Jamon from Spain, and a platter of 4 cheeses recommended by our server. The jamon was aged 5 years and delicious. The perfect amount of firmness, saltiness, and a delectable little snack to pique our interest for what was yet to come. The cheeses complemented each other perfectly. We enjoyed a thoughtful mix of firm and soft cheeses for dessert. <br><br>If you have a special occasion or just enjoy a good tasting menu, get on the waitlist for a reservation here. You can thank me later.\n\\\nWhat a fabulous meal! I had always meant to go here when I lived closer but I found out recently they are going a 5 course meal to take home. <br><br>Now, if plating something nice scares you, it&#39;s not for you but I found it really fun. Mine did not look great but it was fun to try it (and then really appreciate why you have talented people do this at restaurants). <br><br>The food was fantastic and the instructions were easy to follow. They even posted on their Instagram how they would plate the dishes to help you. Love that so much. <br><br>The tuna and the cake were my favourite. I don&#39;t even like chocolate cake but this was almost like brownie with a malted icing and salted caramel Prasil pieces that tasted like toffee crunchy bits. <br><br>Highly suggest if you&#39;re looking for a fancy meal and to try your hand at", "doc_id": "4c731964-ab41-4c94-94e5-7c533e3e1506", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a0b7c01415c4da2ff916609b0485154602149d760603737a335c99a017e2b036", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2815, "end": 6383}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "2": "1066c179-8162-4346-8443-0c0ded03ddef", "3": "5c9a5714-a9d9-42d1-80b5-bd84b4cac113"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c9a5714-a9d9-42d1-80b5-bd84b4cac113": {"__data__": {"text": "to take home. <br><br>Now, if plating something nice scares you, it&#39;s not for you but I found it really fun.

From the grouper to the broccilini (whew) to the main course to the dessert - fantastic.<br><br>And their bread is, as always, amazing.\n\\\nWe&#39;d been trying to make our way to Edulis for what felt like years, but for some reason the timing just never worked out.<br><br>I finally managed to make a reservation for a date that turned out to be right in the midst of the whole Coronavirus thing, with our reservation on one of the restaurant&#39;s final nights before it closed (temporarily, one would hope).<br><br>Anyway, we showed up right on time and were shown to a cozy table right by the bar. It was impressively private for about half hour meal, after which point another couple was seated at a table about eight inches away from us. It was annoying, but expected.<br><br>We decided to start with the plate of hand-sliced Jamon Joselito Gran Reserva ham, which was served with four small house-made breadsticks. It&#39;s definitely quite impressive. Imagine the very best prosciutto you&#39;ve ever had and then multiply that by a million times, and you have the taste of this stuff. It really was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Now, do I feel like it was worth fifty bucks? No, not really.<br><br>But the reason we came was to chow down on the joint&#39;s $105 seven course menu. I wish I could describe each course individually, but Edulis doesn&#39;t provide a menu of the evening&#39;s dishes.<br><br>What I can say is that we enjoyed every course quite a lot, including the delicious bread and butter that kicked off the whole thing. I was impressed, too, that said bread and butter was refilled once during the course of the evening. The bread came in handy when it came time to sop up the various sauces included in certain dishes.<br><br>The theme of the evening was seafood, as the lion&#39;s share of the courses contained some kind of seafood component. The complexity in these dishes was nothing short of incredible, as the food had been meticulously prepared and served - but it was in the often jaw-dropping flavors that Edulis shined.

The food was paired so well with the wine, and they were so accommodating to my dietary restrictions. The ambiance is very intimate, and super romantic. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to celebrate and have a special evening out. They truly make you feel like they care. We can&#39;t wait to go back!!\n\\\nHad an incredibly disappointing lunch at Edulis on Sunday, July 14. Was hesitating on whether or not to actually post -- did I just not understand what I was being served? But I&#39;ll let you be the judge.<br><br>My friend and I arrived at 12pm, didn&#39;t get out until 3:30pm (we&#39;d have probably been there til nearly 4 if I didn&#39;t get the dessert rushed out so we could get out of there). I understand relaxed service (I was at Per Se recently, spent less than three hours there for around double the courses), but we spent the majority of the time at the restaurant waiting (we waited nearly half an hour in between the tomato course and the water buffalo fresco). We noticed that we&#39;d been synced to two other services of two guests each. One of these two tables arrived an hour after we did -- were we slowed down to make food prep easier or something? It can&#39;t have been a cooking time issue, so much of it was just plating stuff.<br><br>The food as a whole was very underwhelming. It&#39;s not to say it was bad, but as a restaurant that&#39;s held the mantle of 7th, 8th, and 10th best Restaurant in Canada for the past few years I have to raise the bar a little bit. Just as I wouldn&#39;t judge an AYCE sushi place about whether or not it&#39;s as good as Shoushin/Zen/etc., I can&#39;t use a low bar to judge a restaurant that&#39;s supposed to be one of the best. Not one dish was mind blowing, and in fact everything seemed quite pedestrian. It honestly felt like there was no thought whatsoever in trying to actually do anything special, some of these presentations are atrocious (ie. the frittata...) There were also basic mistakes like the fried porcinis not being properly salted...<br><br>If this place is actually even top 10 in Canada we&#39;re in a lot of trouble. But I feel like it&#39;d be easy to find 10 places that are better than it just in Toronto/GTA. It just sucks that a tourist might come here, eat this, and think it&#39;s among the best Canada has to offer.

It really really sucks as I was looking forward to eating here a lot after seeing wonderful pictures of previous meals... what on earth happened?!<br><br>Rating: 20/100. It&#39;d be less, but at least service was friendly and trying her best. I&#39;m sorry if I sound harsh, but as a restaurateur there are no off days, sometimes you only get one chance to make an impression, so it&#39;s always gotta be A-Game. And if anyone tries to tell me that was their A game... well, then that&#39;s a bigger problem.\n\\\nWe had a wonderful evening at Edulis. The service was impeccable. Our waiter, Tobey, answered all of our questions, helped us with wine recommendations, and ensured that all dietary needs were met. He and the entire staff were very friendly and accommodating. I never even had to ask to have my water glass refilled! <br><br>The atmosphere was comfortable and cozy. But the highlight of our evening was, of course, the food. We enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu with an additional cheese course. I follow a pescatarian diet, and the chef made amazing substitutions for all meat courses. Typically, when I give my dietary restrictions for a tasting menu, I am given some sort of pasta or light vegetable to replace the meat portions. Although delicious, they normally do not have much substance, and I do not always leave feeling satisfied. However, Edulis replaced meat with fish and hearty vegetables! I truly do appreciate this. Our favorite courses were the lobster dish, the poached salmon dish, and the ahi/meat course. The bread was amazing and there was also an excellent cheese menu to choose from. <br><br>Edulis is definitely worth the price. I highly recommend this restaurant to others looking for a nice evening out!\n\\\nOne of the best restaurants I frequent. Fantastic food and service, always a treat to go. Going during truffle season is definitely worth it\n\\\nReview is actually. 3.5...an excerpt from a longer review. <br><br>&#34;The star of the evening was Dungeness crab from B.C.

While these two ingredients are not a common pairing, the earthiness of the wild mushrooms emphasized the sweetness of the succulent seafood.<br><br>A noticeable lull occurred at this point in the repas, with a long stretch between courses. We migrated from shellfish to fish with Chinook salmon in a shallow pool of dashi broth. What surprised me about the salmon was its unusual ivory flesh -- an apparent result of its diet -- and insipid flavour. Earthy new potatoes and green asparagus accompanied the salmon, but didn&#39;t add anything to the dish&#39;s overall blandness. A pile of poorly chopped herbs covered the whole dish and wasn&#39;t a purposeful treatment to garnish this Asian-inspired dish....&#34;\n\\\nI made reservations online for dinner, within a few hours they called to confirm the reservations, if I was going there the first time and if there were any allergies.<br><br>Food: \\'a0(5 stars)<br>we got the 7 course menu. <br>everything was outstanding.

Our host told us the dishes are frequently changed and there is a completely new menu approximately every 3 weeks, with some dishes changing every few days (so it makes sense they don&#39;t print new menus out all the time). However this also means you need to be comfortable with not knowing what you&#39;re about to pay for.<br><br>There are two options you can order, a 5 course and 7 course for $65 &amp; $85. We were told that the amount of food is roughly the same as the portions will be adjusted down for the 7 course meal, although you will try two extra dishes, so ordering the 7 course meal solely for the purpose of getting more food may not be a feasible option. <br><br>To start they brought out stuffed olives, house-made bread and butter..

We tried the apricot and elderflower which I would highly recommend. <br><br>Atmosphere:<br>The atmosphere is casual, and the restaurant looks like a small cottage inside and out. I think it is very well suited for a date night, as it does have a romantic vibe to it. <br><br>Service:<br>The service is good, not bad by any means but also not anything special. It was about what you expect from a higher end restaurant but nothing over the top. No complaints here.<br><br>Parking:<br>There is a parking garage just around the corner (about a 3 minute walk), with underground parking for about $4 which is nice and convenient. <br><br>Overall I definitely will be going back to try the menu in other seasons as the menu tends to reflect what can be locally sourced and what ingredients are fresh and in season. I&#39;m looking forward to coming back.\n\\\nWent for brunch on a Sunday. I would say 50% of the dishes were excellent! The main entree however was somewhat disappointing.\n\\\nWhere do I even begin. <br>This wonderful little gems is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.<br>Getting a reservation here is a pain because of how small the place is, but every-time I come I am blown away by something.<br><br>I think the reason why Edulis is so special is because of how much attention each dish, plate, and customer is getting. Being small and intimate allows the husband-wife chef duo to truly deliver on a vision and a promise, without the constraints of greed. More over, it allows them to do it themselves. Comparable dishes served at Michelin stars have teams of support preparing each component, but at Edulis, it&#39;s painstakingly done by 2 people primarily. <br><br>The other thing I love about Edulis is how they pick their ingredients. A lot of care and thought is given to each component, which makes even the ancillary things surprise you. For example, the cultured butter they&#39;re using is how butter should taste. The olive oil is complex. The bread is made out of red fife and so rare to find in Toronto. More so, each dish, even in small portions, leaves your taste buds reverberating and satisfyingly searching for more flavour, because the tomatoes taste like tomatoes and the fish is fresh and thoughtful.<br><br>Ok, i&#39;m going to make another reservation now.

We made our reservations a month in advance.<br><br>When we arrived, I was surprised to find that Edulis was situated in a small residence-like shop. Its storefront was gorgeous with a small patio and beautiful colourful flowers. Inside, I was further surprised to find that the entire restaurant was very dimly lit and actually didn&#39;t have a lot of tables for seating. \\'a0<br><br>We were served &#34;filtered Q&#34; water with a charge of $2 per person. \\'a0The menu stated, &#34;Thank you for not using your cell phone at the table.&#34;<br><br>Edulis&#39;s tasting menus are based around seafood, vegetables, and wild mushrooms, which is quite different than other tasting menus which involve meat. \\'a0The cuisine is Mediterranean and Spanish-influenced.<br><br>We started off with a bread served with a tomato paste, filtered butter, and a skewer of bread and anchovy-stuffed olive. \\'a0<br><br>One thing that I didn&#39;t like is that because their lighting was so dim (candlelight only), you could barely see what you were eating (never mind wanting to take a nice photo to commemorate the meal). \\'a0All of the other tasting menus that I have experienced before have had natural or white lighting so that you could see and admire the workmanship that was put into each individual dish. \\'a0I hope this is something that Edulis can consider changing in the future. \\'a0Food also tastes better when you can see it clearly and enjoy the visual aesthetics of it. I love seeing how each ingredient is put together on the dish and it&#39;s a shame that we weren&#39;t able to do this (especially when it&#39;s a tasting menu that&#39;s pricier than eating out at regular restaurants, I really wanted to maximize my experience).<br><br>Anyway, the bread was quite good. \\'a0It was soft and had a good texture. \\'a0The tomato paste was very fresh. \\'a0The butter was smooth and rich. We were told to eat the skewer of bread and stuffed olive together in one bite. \\'a0<br><br>The 1st course we received was a cold dish of New Zealand garoupa. \\'a0It was fresh and pretty good. \\'a0<br><br>The 2nd course was a scallop on a shell. \\'a0This was fresh and the herbs gave it a very strong aroma. \\'a0Since the scallop was cooked on the shell, it took some digging with the spoon to get it off the shell. <br><br>After every course, our plates were cleared and our old cutlery were replaced with new ones. \\'a0<br><br>The 3rd was a Nova Scotia lobster prepared with Saskatchewan mushroom and Ontario grits. \\'a0This smelled amazing. \\'a0I was so enthralled especially because the flavours marinated so well together. \\'a0The bisque was like a foam covering the ingredients. \\'a0This was delicious.<br><br>The", "doc_id": "83f9be79-a078-41b8-b7a2-884b0396017b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ccdb9d16253cdf2776092b4cb4487afd7cc0c5931bcdc228fd8f97806a87b4b9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 24547, "end": 28097}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "2": "a3f114c4-8e33-430b-8e90-d25367881de4", "3": "10fbc0bb-3c7a-463c-b02b-3686a852cbef"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "10fbc0bb-3c7a-463c-b02b-3686a852cbef": {"__data__": {"text": "was fresh and pretty good. \\'a0<br><br>The 2nd course was a scallop on a shell. \\'a0This was fresh and the herbs gave it a very strong aroma. \\'a0Since the scallop was cooked on the shell, it took some digging with the spoon to get it off the shell. <br><br>After every course, our plates were cleared and our old cutlery were replaced with new ones. \\'a0<br><br>The 3rd was a Nova Scotia lobster prepared with Saskatchewan mushroom and Ontario grits. \\'a0This smelled amazing. \\'a0I was so enthralled especially because the flavours marinated so well together. \\'a0The bisque was like a foam covering the ingredients. \\'a0This was delicious.<br><br>The 4th course was a slightly smoked salmon from B.C.

Often times I will ask specific questions about different ingredients and they always take the time to explain everything to me in detail. <br><br>I can&#39;t say enough wonderful things about Edulis, Toronto is very lucky to have this restaurant in our city.\n\\\nBy far one of the worst tasting menus I&#39;ve ever had. \\'a0<br><br>First course: \\'a0Bonito with cucumber and black garlic - way too much vinegar in the cucumbers which burns your throat and overpowers the delicate fish. <br><br>Second course - Lightly smoked lake trout with white asparagus and vinaigrette- too lightly flavored in my opinion. <br><br>Third course - Scallop with scallop roe - the scallop was too tough and chewy, which means that it was cooked too long. \\'a0Poor technique. \\'a0<br><br>Fourth course - Soft shell crab with ramps and romesco - Absolutely awful. \\'a0Meager piece of crab that was over battered, tasted like oil and fried stuff, could not taste the crab with all that batter. There was hardly any romesco sauce. \\'a0It came off like a really bad piece of shrimp tempura. \\'a0I&#39;ve had better soft shell crab in a sushi roll. \\'a0<br><br>Fifth course - Saucy rice with halibut cheeks and mushrooms - This dish was way too salty. \\'a0It might&#39;ve been enjoyable if not for that. \\'a0<br><br>Sixth course - Lamb with chorizo and asparagus - The lamb was cooked medium rare but still was tough and chewy, not to mention flavorless. \\'a0We swear that the meat must not be good quality. <br><br>Seventh course - Rhubarb sorbet on rhubarb compote - Believe it or not, this was the best part of our meal. \\'a0Sweet and tart of the rhubarb was perfectly balanced. \\'a0<br><br>Rhubarb tart with tonka bean cream - The filling was too sweet. \\'a0The tart shell was a little hard. \\'a0But the tonka bean cream was delicious. \\'a0<br><br>All in all, my friend and I were hard pressed to decide which was the worst dish of them all. \\'a0It just went steadily downhill from the first savory course to the last. \\'a0We couldn&#39;t figure out if the ingredients were of subpar quality, or the chef lacked skill, or if we just got really bad dishes. \\'a0We were highly disappointed, especially considering that we paid $100 each for the meal.", "doc_id": "e76b2f89-a96e-4d83-b5ba-e2829445a213", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ee003eeb70a564fa020038a230af1a62a4103d7163dd0440db4ffe566b5d65b4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 31552, "end": 35063}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "2": "10fbc0bb-3c7a-463c-b02b-3686a852cbef", "3": "e72f5cd4-b9df-49f3-bde0-54fe2e58aced"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e72f5cd4-b9df-49f3-bde0-54fe2e58aced": {"__data__": {"text": "- Believe it or not, this was the best part of our meal. \\'a0Sweet and tart of the rhubarb was perfectly balanced. \\'a0<br><br>Rhubarb tart with tonka bean cream - The filling was too sweet. \\'a0The tart shell was a little hard. \\'a0But the tonka bean cream was delicious. \\'a0<br><br>All in all, my friend and I were hard pressed to decide which was the worst dish of them all. \\'a0It just went steadily downhill from the first savory course to the last. \\'a0We couldn&#39;t figure out if the ingredients were of subpar quality, or the chef lacked skill, or if we just got really bad dishes. \\'a0We were highly disappointed, especially considering that we paid $100 each for the meal. \\'a0Would absolutely not come here again.\n\\\nOh this is a cute little restaurant where when you get in, you feel like you&#39;re in France again! \\'a0Edulis, where do I even begin? \\'a0<br><br>Reservations are notoriously hard to get but we were lucky to snag one relatively easily. \\'a0You can also use the DINR app for last minute reservations. \\'a0I believe they are hard to book b/c like most high end restaurants, they stagger their tables and do not turn them over. <br><br>They offer two tasting menus, the 5 and the 7 course one. \\'a0If you are hungry, definitely go for the 7 course one. \\'a0We were offered a variety of seafood dishes, all of which were absolutely beautiful. \\'a0Each dish presented flavours, which danced in your mouth. \\'a0Their main courses featured a fish dish and a pork dish. \\'a0I was a great fan of the fish dish. \\'a0The pork dish, unfortunately, was good but not mind-blowing. \\'a0The cider marinade that they put on the pork was quite overwhelming and presented a bit of a bitter taste, which was not my cup of tea. \\'a0Dessert was a sorbet with a meringue, which was good as well. \\'a0<br><br>Service was great and we had a very friendly server who introduced all the dishes to us. \\'a0We were really quite happy with our experience. \\'a0I can see why Edulis is one of Canada&#39;s top restaurants. \\'a0My recommendation would be to try Edulis before you can score a reservation at Canada&#39;s #1 restaurant (Alo). \\'a0The latter restaurant really set the bar high for us...like really really high and I almost felt like it wasn&#39;t fair when I assessed Edulis because Alo is pretty hard to beat. \\'a0All in all, Edulis was a fantastic experience and I will definitely visit again. \\'a0<br><br>It was also the bf&#39;s birthday and they took the extra time to do something special for him, which was just so sweet. \\'a0So thank you, Edulis for a wonderful night!!\n\\\nAmazing food and incredible service. Our server was fantastic, made great wine pairing recommendations for us which were much appreciated. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, perfect for the double date we were on with friends. 10/10 great experience!\n\\\nIt is still one of my favourite \\'a0restaurants. Reservations are hard to come by- they work on a 30 day cycle, so go online thinking 30 days in advance. The tasting menu is phenomenal.

The service, the attentiveness, the home-baked bread, the Gilda to start, the wine pairings, the exquisitely crafted tiny plates... Cannot speak highly enough of this establishment.\n\\\nEdulis is named one of Canada&#39;s best restaurant by EnRoute Magazine in 2012. You can see why when you try their tasting menu. The 7 course tasting menu is inspired and reasonably priced. \\'a0<br><br>The dining room is small. It is a great place for a date. It dining room has a rustic - romantic feel. \\'a0The service is attentive.<br><br>The food is exceptional. Seafood is a huge part of the tasting menu. If you are a fan of seafood (like me), you will love Edulis. The seafood is fresh and flavours are enhanced with unique ingredients. <br><br>I would highly recommend Edulis.\n\\\nEdulis is amazing. The food is European in nature and the flavours are explosive yet comforting in nature. The savouries are a revelation. Desserts are good but aren&#39;t at the level of the previous courses. Seafood is spectacular. The last main is always a responsibly sourced meat, sometimes dry aged veal or duck or Berkshire pork, served with seasonal vegetable that is absurdly flavourful. Service is wonderful and personable. Really a can&#39;t miss place and a totally singular experience. Well deserved top 5 restaurant in Canada\n\\\nEdulis never disappoints! We love to visit for their Sunday lunch/ brunch and always have an enjoyable afternoon! the service is perfection and the food is a delight- always something new and different. <br>The half-price wine bottles is a wonderful touch and certainly helps with the overall experience :) <br><br>While we have had dinner there, we much prefer the lunch option for the pricing and relaxed ambiance. The overall experience is like an afternoon stroll in a small French town.\n\\\nSmall rustic french cuisine spot. Came here for the tasting menu with my family for a birthday celebration. Great service overall w/ good explanation of each dish as they arrived! I must say their ingredients were really fresh! Some of the textures ive never tasted before! Overall great experience - should try the tasting menu at least once! Was not a fan of their dessert however.\n\\\nPlease note this review is written with in mind the price range and expected the semi-fine dining experience. Had the 5 course set menu with no wine pairing. It was overall a good experience, though I had higher expectations due to high reviews on the spot from friends and online reviews. Service was not the most attentive but it seems like it was just a lack of experience. <br><br>The first four dishes were good but didn&#39;t stand out. Our last dish which was supposed to be the anchor to the entire show was a chicken based dish and was slightly underwhelming. The flavoring was off and not balanced and the texture of the chicken was not very tender.

Might give it another shot for lunch, i think we were partly unlucky and encountered the relatively less impressive set of courses.\n\\\nWe came on Dec 29 for dinner after hearing good things about the restaurant and weeks of trying to book a table. The overall experience was positive but not amazing and we were a bit of disappointed with the service. One person from our group has been there before and she said it was great last time, so it seems it&#39;s a hit or miss from time to time given the menu changes a lot. <br><br>The 5 year aged Jamon (add-on) was delicious. The first 3 courses in our set menu was great and they were focused on seafood, which is what Edulis is known for and what came for. For the main, we had a chicken and mushroom dish which was a bit of disappointing. We didn&#39;t expect to have a chicken dish as main on the set menu from a restaurant known for seafood. For the dessert, we had a bitter orange sorbet which wasn&#39;t my type of dessert but the rest of group enjoyed it. <br><br>Essentially the food was worth the price but the portion is definitely on the small side. The service was what really made us a bit disappointed. It wasn&#39;t that busy on that night, but the service was slow. We also didn&#39;t get the menus even when we have sat down for like 20 min. We had to ask for the menu and didn&#39;t have enough time to read it before we ordered. It would be better to have the menu published somewhere on the website or in the venue so the guests could have a better idea what to expect before coming in on that day.\n\\\nOverall the experience is OK, but not powerful enough for repeated visits.<br><br>My first visit is with my mother. \\'a0<br><br>The ambience is cozy and romantic.<br><br>The service was great, absolutely nothing to pick on. \\'a0We ordered warm water, and they brought us a cute owl shaped teapot. \\'a0<br><br>The food is fresh, and daring. \\'a0I could tell the chef put a lot of effort in preparing the ingredients and the meal. \\'a0<br><br>We both ordered the 7 course meal.<br>I will summarize the experience was like a rollercoaster ride.<br>In general all the seafood dishes and fresh.<br><br>The bread on the table is decent, but not to the level for me to finish the mini sack. \\'a0It is not hot/warm, something I take notice as a must for restaurant that cares about their customers.<br><br>The first fish dish was with sour apple dice. \\'a0Not a big fan of it.<br><br>The second scallops fish was to die for. \\'a0If I can order, I will eat 30 order by myself. \\'a0 My mother agreed with my assessment. \\'a0It has the hint of yazu.<br><br>The 3rd dish is another fish dish with eggplant and mushroom. \\'a0Nothing special, unless you count the server pour in the soup at the table (something Canoe did already).<br><br>The 4th dish is pike, and amazing. \\'a0The surprising element was the almond nuts.<br><br>The", "doc_id": "2537ad5d-7ed5-45c4-b3a1-e11526cc46cf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0a8c46e0f998fe010e70c452bc93de1abfea1298c3b4c01c541934b108b64c2e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 42307, "end": 45941}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "2": "888af98b-3d6f-4fe8-b00a-8d33105417d6", "3": "965538a7-6f30-4fd5-a38e-54f13908513f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "965538a7-6f30-4fd5-a38e-54f13908513f": {"__data__": {"text": "\\'a0It is not hot/warm, something I take notice as a must for restaurant that cares about their customers.<br><br>The first fish dish was with sour apple dice. \\'a0Not a big fan of it.<br><br>The second scallops fish was to die for. \\'a0If I can order, I will eat 30 order by myself. \\'a0 My mother agreed with my assessment. \\'a0It has the hint of yazu.<br><br>The 3rd dish is another fish dish with eggplant and mushroom. \\'a0Nothing special, unless you count the server pour in the soup at the table (something Canoe did already).<br><br>The 4th dish is pike, and amazing. \\'a0The surprising element was the almond nuts.<br><br>The rest of the dishes are not worth mentioning. \\'a0The stuff squid just have special ink appearance. \\'a0The squid nor stuffing taste good. \\'a0The duck was salty. \\'a0The cake and cream we took 1 bite and didn&#39;t finish. \\'a0The cake is drowned with rum. \\'a0The cream was over whipped. \\'a0 \\'a0 I would be happier if you just give me a piece of chocolate.<br><br>Overall the portion is on the small side, and will not be enough for any big eaters. \\'a0Luckily we ordered the 7 and not the 5 course meal, or else I will not even get to try the yummy scallops.<br><br>I doubt I will return.\n\\\nI came here for their Sunday brunch (with half price bottles of wine), and had an overall excellent experience. <br><br>The food was generally very good, the ingredients were high quality, and the flavours were all unique and delicious.

As well, we ordered three cheeses with our dessert, another modification that I think elevated the meal. \\'a0<br><br>We paid $250 for 2 people with two bottles of wine, and extras including cheese and scallops. We left feeling very full and spent 3 full hours at the restaurant. In my opinion, the price was quite fair.<br><br>I&#39;d recommend it, and I will be going back for dinner to see how it compares.\n\\\nThis is by far the best food experience in Toronto. The food and service are amazing. Treat yourself with the 7 course tasting and you won&#39;t be disappointed.\n\\\nHands down the best meal I have had in Toronto. Every dish was perfect! It&#39;s obvious that they go to great lengths to source the freshest seafood, and vegetables at their peak. The service was also impeccable. Plan to spend 2.5 to 3.5 hours for dinner.... it&#39;s well worth it.\n\\\nChef did a great job with plating and the ambience is awesome. \\'a0Food was well made but expect portion to be small. \\'a0Every dish that it came out gives you a little surprise because of the beautiful plating and the use of colour. \\'a0Feels like eating a piece of Art. \\'a0The poached Goose Liver was the best I ever tried. \\'a0Highly recommended to try this place if you are willing to spent the money.\n\\\nFinally came here on Canada Day for the 7 course tasting menu<br>Really amazing flavours &amp; presentation<br>Wine suggestions bang on <br>Dessert on the patio with vintage port\n\\\nEdulis was fantastic, every step of the way.

What I didn&#39;t like was all the dishes were very fish focused (3 of the 7), and they weren&#39;t much of my liking except for the first course, yellow tail sashimi - very refreshing and flavorful. Second course was the mushroom which was my favorite dish of the night - tiny diced king oyster mushroom mixed in with flavorful dressing. Third course were shrimps, the meat was cooked perfectly, really soft. Fourth course was salmon with asparagus, this was just okay for me - the salmon was a bit overcooked for my liking. Fifth course was a fried cod, but the cod was soggy being served in the sauce. Sixth course was a veal served with sausage and short rib. The short rib pieces were really tough. The veal was good but nothing special. Surprisingly from that dish I liked the sausage the most. Last course was dessert, some kind of sorbet like ice cream served on top of Mascarpone cheese.<br><br>One thing that bothered me slightly was our waiter didnt explain our dishes with much detail unlike the other waiters. When I asked him what the main difference between the 5 and 7 course is (in regards to the food options), he couldn&#39;t even say....but he&#39;s been serving these dishes all night right?<br>Regardless i enjoyed my experience here.

All I can say is that it was simple fabulous and lived up to every bit of my expectation. Service was friendly and top notch. Overall, the place seemed cramped and the small tables could only hold about 2-3 dishes at a time. But who cares about size when quality is all that matters. Parking might be an issue but there is a Green P around the corner about 2 blocks away on King Street. We paid $10 to park on a weekend and we were at the restaurant for about 2 hours. I highly recommend Edulis.\n\\\nDecember 2016 - 5 course Menu $85<br><br>Read lots of positive reviews for this restaurant, and decided to splurge a bit for a belated birthday celebration...needless to say with much regret that we will not be returning again, but let us explore why.<br><br>Ambiance of the restaurant was dark and perhaps to feign a romantic setting; maybe quaint is the word to describe it. To be honest, more light would be appreciated, since I wasn&#39;t able to see what I was eating. <br><br>Service was awful. Miss Waitress must really hate her job because she made minimal communication with us especially when it came to explaining food (She named the dish and that was it. Also didn&#39;t help the restaurant was so loud). It was quite intimidating to see how peeved she was at us when we asked for more time to make a decision on our orders (One of us had dietary restrictions, so reviewing the ingredients is justified.) A big part of the experience is feeling valued as a customer; I did not feel valued at all. Needless to say her attitude was sending patrons running for the hills. At the same time, couldn&#39;t be too upset with her since she did put a candle on our cake (speculating an emotionally conflicted lady)...<br><br>Food was alright, but did not quite fulfill expectations--we ordered the 5 course menu ($85 each) <br><br>[OK] Bread: The edge of the bread was hard as a rock, but the inside was quite soft. And so, had only 1 piece and discarded the rough edges. It was especially good with the homemade butter.<br><br>[BEST DISH] Squid: This was probably the best dish because you can actually taste the marinade in this one! Al dente bite to the squid and the crispy thing on top added more texture to it. The portion was unfortunately quite minuscule--think of a golf ball cut in half. <br><br>[MEH] Seabass + sprocket: Fish was not overcooked which was fantastic and the sprockets made the dish look pretty. Not my favourite, but it was good. Definition of good is the following--think of a boiled chicken breast. It is good for you but bland (that kind of good).<br><br>[HELLS NO] Fish &amp; beets: Couldn&#39;t remember the exact name of this dish, but it was truly the worse one on the menu.

I am not sure why there is such a big hype for this restaurant, but probably because the menus were different from our Dec 2016 selection. I suppose this style of cooking is not really to our palate&#39;s liking. \\'a0The score would have been higher had we received better service, but we will not return again to find out because I don&#39;t like having to visit McD for a second meal after spending so much.\n\\\nI went to Edulis last night with friends having heard good things about this restaurant.<br><br>I arrived at about 7 and the restaurant was quite empty but it quickly filled up.

Although it wasn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s fault, my entire time there was overshadowed by the rude table behind us who were drunk and talked at near-shouting volumes the whole night (it was a long 3 hours...) There were only 6 tables in our half of the restaurant and it was clear that the other patrons were disturbed by the noise.. <br><br>As for the food, we got the 5-course tasting menu with the chestnut dumpling-truffle add on. I really wanted to try the white truffle risotto but it was just too pricey at $80 each person and I think at least 2 people at the table had to order it. Each course was tiny but tasted light and delicate. The portion sizes left me craving for more... We got scallops, mackerel(?), squid and a lobster/chicken dish. The chestnut dumplings with truffles were really nothing special and I don&#39;t recommend getting them. We also ordered 2 cheeses before dessert: a camembert and gouda and both were delicious. The desserts were probably the strongest-tasting part of the meal... we got a tangy citrus buffalo milk froyo (?) and a slice of rum cake to share that was realllyy heavy on the rum flavour. <br><br>The restaurant decor and service were unpretentious. Overall I think this is a restaurant worth visiting for special occasions.\n\\\nOne of Toronto&#39;s best places to dine. Food, atmosphere and service are all exemplary.<br>As a seafood lover there were many options on the menu and some specials in addition. <br>Family run with a tight staff who work well together.\n\\\n-There are two tasting menus available: 5 courses ($65) and 7 courses ($85), each course is tasting portion (tiny). <br>-menu is heavily evolve around seafood and vegetables, thus if you prefer meat, you might not enjoy Edulis as there was only 1 meat dish out of the 7 courses.<br>-Each dishes were not heavily seasoned which allowed the natural flavors of the combined ingredients to shine. The flow of all the courses made sense: from light to heavy. <br>-Food was really good. Only complain is the rhum cake. The cake was incredibly soggy as the server was too heavy-handed on the rum.<br><br>SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. <br>She was condescending and rude toward our table. She essentially treated us as kids. Maybe she had a bad day, but trust me, I was a server previously and I would never treat the customers in such disrespectfully manner. Why?

I went here with my boyfriend last night and had the 7 course tasting menu. Although we were tempted to add the additional white trifle risotto course, it was an extra $85/plate and you had to order 2 portions because that was how the ride was cooked. When we arrived at the restaurant the table beside us had just received the risotto plate and there was an over generous amount of truffle and the smell was exquisite. I spoke to our lovely waitress about the extra cavier and truffle dishes and she mentioned that they are on the menu at cost to make them more accessible to patrons. With that said, I will definitely be going back to indulge in these delicacies!<br>The 7 course meal that we did have was mainly seafood and vegetables which is the restaurant&#39;s specialty. Every dish was very unique but had a similar light, crisp, fresh taste, that got richer as the meal went on. My favourite of the evening would be the mackerel which had a side of greens in a vinigrette dressing. My second favourite would have to be the first dessert course (since I have such a big sweet tooth). It was a spice cake with a citrus sorbet and pestacio cream. This course had a great balance between light, rich and citrus. The last course was the rum bubba cake which was almost like an angela food cake doused in a rum syrup and served with a Chantilly cream. They also pour extra rum syrup at your table when the dish is served which I wasn&#39;t a fan of because the rum was too strong for me but my boyfriend still enjoyed it! <br>Overall amazing. Definitely in my top 5 of restaurants in the city and will definitely go back.\n\\\nI found this place online on one of the best restaurants of Toronto list; it was my dad&#39;s birthday so I wanted to find some place tasty. I was pretty excited for the tasting menu and we both opted for the 7 courses at $85 (the 5 course is $65). <br><br>We arrived at 6 PM and don&#39;t think left until around 9 PM, the meal took a while, with each dish taking a bit of time before arriving to us. This was fine as it gave us time to savour the dishes and we were in no rush anyways. <br><br>The food was quite good, the dishes were as follow as best of my memory:<br>1. Nova Scotia ahi tuna<br>2.

We decided to get the 7 course dinner and we added an additional course of caviar which was 55 dollars a plate. We also added an extra cheese course which became on the house due to a delay between our 2nd and 3rd course. We didn&#39;t actually notice a delay but the fact that they stand by their service and product speaks volumes to me. All together it came to about 373, which I wouldn&#39;t do very often since we came for a special occasion, but I was informed they have a 40 dollar Sunday lunch which I think would be an amazing way to revisit!\n\\\nThis restaurant provides you with a food adventure delivering complex flavours with an intimate dining experience!

This restaurant definitely exceeded my expectations.\n\\\nSeriously, how good can a seemingly over priced meal be? Friggin AMAZING!!! The intricate flavours working together to give your palate an orgasm. Definitely should come here if you&#39;re a Torontoian as this is easily one of the best restaurants in our growing city.\n\\\nWe went to Edulis 3 times over the course of the last 2 years, and loved our 2 first experiences which would have deserved 4 stars. The last time was more of a 3 stars/A-OK style of experience.<br>We typically go for the 5 or 7 meal menu with some wine. Their wine selection is ok. We were really amazed the first time, even if the service isn&#39;t exactly fast there, but when you enjoy the evening it&#39;s not an issue. The following time was excellent as well, whereas our last dinner was less exciting, with a less inspired menu. The execution was ok, it looked great, but from a taste perspective something \\'a0was missing. <br>In Toronto, now, you can not afford to be a hit or miss experience in this price range (100-150 per person once you add everything) .... There is so much competition.... <br>I still put 4 stars, but the last experience is definitely 3*, A-OK at best.\n\\\nEdulis continues to combine consistent quality of food and service with never ending variety of dishes changing daily according to the freshest and highest quality ingredients sourced locally as often as possible. The chicken is free range, the corn is specially sourced non genetically modified, the cheeses are from the Cheese Boutique, etc. The best available ingredients go into the meal. Michael and Tobey are always in the kitchen which explains the &#39;consistency&#39; part of it. On the other side are the efficient waitstaff keeping the dishes coming in a relaxed, laid back style for a place with high food standards. Meticulous attention to detail from music selection to choice of dishes and cutlery help the small, intimate place feel cozy and relaxed, occasionally loud but in an animated way. The food is ...eclectic. Greens and herbs or fish which require a dictionary at times but it all tastes sooo good. Never the same so the surprise is on us.

No truffles. 3 hours. Should have been 2 hours. We were served 3 courses in 2 hours and then 4 courses in 60 minutes. Not good. Server was very professional but kitchen was slow. Dishes are very small - even for 7 courses. I informed in advance this was a birthday dinner but no special attention was given. I expected a candle at least (?). \\'a0The bill came half way through dessert. Not impressive especially after long waits between first courses and a rushed 2nd half. Flavours were very good and wines were well paired. One course was &#34;Fogo Island cod tongues from Nova Scotia&#34; (Uhm... Fogo island is in Newfoundland FYI). The tongues were previously frozen. They were served with a delicious ragu however. All dishes served just above room temp. No dish even close to hot. Cheeses were incredible. Mushroom consume was perfection. Chicken was mediocre. I can&#39;t imagine truffles (+$30pp) adding to our experience so don&#39;t bother. The ambiance is tight and (on this night) loud. If you&#39;re dying to go, get the 5 course menu and order a bottle of wine. You might get out for under $250. PS. Wait for warm weather.

They have 3 or 6 courses to choose from however everything is a surprise.. they would of course ask if there were any allergies. \\'a0<br>Overall the food, service, and wine was amazing. <br>They explained each course up to the garnish and sauces.<br>Cannot wait to come back :)\n\\\nOne word - INCREDIBLE. \\'a0This restaurant is absolutely fabulous. \\'a0The food was just out of this world good, delicious and the service was perfect. \\'a0I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation!\n\\\nIt&#39;s been awhile since I last posted, but I felt that this one would be warranted...<br><br>Currently sitting in Edulis, waiting for our last course.<br><br>Our reservation began at 7pm and it is currently past 11:30pm. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu along with 2 bottles of wine (special occasion, it&#39;s our anniversary!). <br><br>The food is amazing. Very seafood forward with the last course being duck. The home made bread is fantastic. They even own a duck press - they take out the breast and legs and press the rest - sounds amazing, and it really is. You have a choice of a cheese platter at the end and it&#39;s totally divine.<br><br>However, it&#39;s been almost 5 hours and I&#39;m still sitting here. As entertaining as my boyfriend is, I have to work tomorrow. And to make things worse, they removed my wine glass, when we still had wine left in the bottle. I miss my puppy at home and I just want the damn bill. It should not take 45 minutes per course.\n\\\nFood 5 star<br>Service 4 star<br>Drinks were below average and the cocktails can be better. <br><br>it wasn&#39;t really traditional, but all the ingredients where fabulous the flavor really good, beautiful execution for \\'a0each dish, food was great we ate a 8 course meal and it was pretty good <br>Dessert was some kind of cake with rum just poor in it. it was delicious best dessert I had.\n\\\nCame here in the dead heat of summer after a 3 week reservation with my other half. I&#39;ve had this place marked for some time, specifically coming for their truffle menu. We were lucky to experience truffles in the summer months, as they were flown in from Australia. We ordered the extended 7 courses, which felt like a marathon to get through. Normally I&#39;m up for the experience, but 4 hours was a little long... and after a bottle of wine and some cocktails, I was ready to Zzzz.

Rather it puts all of its efforts and focus on what matters, the food.<br><br>Each dish is meticulously crafted to bring out and compliment the natural flavours and textures of the seasonal ingredients.<br><br>Delicious, simple and memorable. My wife and I went all out and got the 7 course with white truffle for our anniversary.

(Albeit, not anytime soon, without selling an arm/leg)...\n\\\nRarely does a restaurant transcend banality, leap beyond trend and showmanship, and take a diner on a journey to an unexplored culinary experience. \\'a0Edulis did this, providing fun, laughter and comfort along the way. \\'a0 My dinner will be added to my most memorable restaurant experiences. \\'a0Edulis is one of the best restaurants in the world, deserving of multiple Michelin stars.<br><br>Consisting of two, low ceiling, candlelit rooms, Edulis discards hip for warmth. \\'a0Our server, Dana, was charming and knowledgable, helping us navigate through the meal with pleasure. \\'a0We added a gorgeous $80 bottle of Alsatian Sylvaner to our meal and settled back for the five course prix fix dinner.

I am so glad we finally got to try this place. If you are not in a rush, treat yourself to a wonderful and intimate dining experience. <br><br>The 5 of us arrived for a birthday celebration Saturday at 630. Reservations are recommended due to the small dining area and they can only accommodate up to 6 people in a party. Our coats are taken and we are seated right away. We decide to go for the 7 courses for $85 rather than the 5 courses. We opted out of the truffle add on for $60. We started with a bottle of cava rosee for $80 and then went with a French recommendation for $60. <br><br>Bread and olives are delicious and they will bring more bread if you finish. <br><br>The menu changes with whatever is fresh but here is what we had:<br><br>1. Spanish mackerel with citrus dressing and fennel. My fave of the night. <br>2. Heirloom carrot, leek, porcini and chrons (tubar -- root veggie)<br>3. Scallop and marcona almond, broccoli long pepper sauce.<br>4. Japanese eggplant with smoked bonito smoked over hay....nagi onions and fried onions.<br>5. Nova Scotia Hagfish, pureed potatoes and cider sauce. Amazing! <br>6. Duck with shredded duck wing and chanterelle mushrooms. Beans and sausage with foie gras.<br>7. Quince sorbet with pumpkin and pistachio...with fresh persimmon<br>Sent from my BlackBerry 10 smartphone on the Rogers network.<br><br>The meal was 4 hours. I love long meals with good friends. Having said that, \\'a0I think it took a little too long between course 6 and 7.<br><br>Total cost with tax and tip was approx. $715 for 5 people. <br><br>Definitely a great place to check out on a special (or any!) occasion.\n\\\nThis restaurant is the real deal. The dishes were thoughtful and perfectly sized. The drinks were perfectly paired and appropriately priced. The service was impeccable but not overly attentive. It was a real pleasure to eat here. Each of the dishes was fancy but not too fluffy. The ingredients were hearty, but not overly seasoned to allow the flavours to shine on their own. You can really feel the chef&#39;s heart and soul in the entire experience.

A western version of omakase or even kaiseki.\n\\\nAmazing. By far one of the best prefixe menus I have ever had. Every single dish was perfection. I highly highly highly recommend.\n\\\nFirst time going into a restaurant that has no menu, the only options are &#34;5 or 7 courses&#34;. They also wrote &#34;put your belly on us&#34; so I trust them without asking any questions. There&#39;s no disappointment from appetizer to dessert, everything was very tasty. Servers were very knowledgeable and attentive. The atmosphere was very cozy. They change their dishes every month and I can&#39;t wait to go back when its truffle season!!\n\\\nOverall a great experience. \\'a0The service was excellent and so was the food. \\'a0The seafood was amazing\n\\\nBlown away by the large tasting menu. The menu was seafood-heavy and everything I tasted was delicious. My favorites were the prawns two ways, lamb and the smoked catfish. Have to admit I shuddered when I heard catfish because it can get fishy if not prepared right, but this was so delicate and mild I wish I had more on the plate! The shallot soubise it came with was so good I wanted to lick the plate...The preserved peach with elderflower jelly had the perfect balance between sweet and tart. This was the splurge meal of my visit and did not disappoint. Servers were very knowledgeable and patient about explaining the dishes and answering questions.\n\\\nTop notch. One of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life. Service was flawless. Food was mind blowing. The ambiance was very intimate and nice. Would have paid whatever they wanted for that meal. Cannot wait to go back.\n\\\nHad the best experience here recently. This place only does tasting menus and boy are they good at it. I can&#39;t say I enjoyed every dish they served but that was more because of my taste rather than a result of poor execution. The intimate atmosphere was seductive and cozy, comfortable. Dimly lit with flickering candles at each table. Casual dressy. Literally 15 tables or less. You choose between a 5 or 7 course menu (menu changes nightly and even so the server cant tell you what the chef will decide to serve or in what order, I noticed tables next to us were getting some things similar some things different). The difference in the two menus is the variety, not the amount of food. Well worth the extra $20/per for the variety. There was also a truffle scrambled egg dish to add ($20/per) or a truffle fish dish to substitute (dont remember if there was an added cost). Here were our plates: <br>1. raw fish salad - sorry i forget the name of the fish or the dish lol. but so light and flavourful, and the fish taste was so clean. the vegetables they used were so tasty together with the fish (im not a salad lover generally)<br>2. potato puree with shrimp - OMG. mindblown. if you like amaebi (sweet botan shrimp japanese cuisine) you would love this dish.. the shrimp is half cooked in the smoothest potato puree ever.. qnd i have a feeling it was cooking in the puree.. a wonderful explosion of flavours and textures in my mouth..<br>3.", "doc_id": "e6253e0a-8360-4c11-b22b-367b4c23d4f0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "849fac4147bbe2ddb9aacd3694a5e72dd206c99ba19b06bf06db1b3fa4f54286", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 89544, "end": 93188}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "2": "0c70ac1f-48d1-4597-822d-21af20b96716", "3": "8026c5da-f4ec-4cb4-b75b-bf75880fb6c7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8026c5da-f4ec-4cb4-b75b-bf75880fb6c7": {"__data__": {"text": "add ($20/per) or a truffle fish dish to substitute (dont remember if there was an added cost).

I can&#39;t even tell it&#39;s egg. There were bacon bits but this flavour did NOT overpower the other flavours.. There were 2 layers of a sort of airy savoury cream with the truffle infused scrambled egg at the bottom.. it was so smooth.. the taste was so mesmerizing.. wanted to crack the eggshell and slurp the inner shell clean.. every $3 spoonful was worth it. the spoon is half a teaspoon in size lol. <br>There was also a risotto dish (very nice), a hare loin dish (not a big fam of game meat but still tried it and it was a heavier contrasting taste compared to the other lighter dishes but had a nice salad on the side), a sausage and fried eel dish in apple salad that i did not really enjoy (bits of eel had too much batter and tasted like oil, i prefer grilled eel, and the acidity of the green apple slices with this fatty eel and salty sausage i didnt enjoy, and a dish with japanese charcoal torched fish.. yum. Very different tastes, textures, international ingredients/techniques used. Really appreciated the creativity and versatility of the chefs!! Was a good 2.5hour meal.. no rush.. romantic music.. i easily mentally transported myself to a virtual doppleganger restaurant set in the evening cobblestone streets of paris and on a patio with the music live in front of you. With each course you get a change in utensils and plates. Servers are quick friendly and professional. This restaurant has a mixed ethnicities crowd. the overall vibe i got was that this was an exclusive restaurant that i was lucky to be at and that not many ppl knew about (despite it being rated top 100 restaurants for the past couple years).\n\\\nRating: 4.5 stars<br>Overall: Lovely, delicious food with a good price-to-quality ratio with European-style, gentle service and cozy space reflective of the co-owners&#39; personalities. Would go again.<br><br>Food: Seven-course tasting menu with additional courses of truffled egg with maple cream and cheese tasting plate. Only two &#34;eh, could be better&#34; dishes in terms of execution/combination of flavours and the rest were very solid to excellent. Dessert was unique, incredibly delicious, and memorable -- rhubarb in a bruleed blood orange sabayon with star anise meringue. Whoever is their saucier should be applauded.

It almost verges on languid. Our nine-course meal took four hours, sometimes with more than a few overly lengthy waits for food. We thought they forgot our dessert at one point. People looking for lengthier explanations of where the food comes should temper their expectations, especially going to a place touted for its local sourcing of ingredients. We had to pour our own water many times and we got a bit thirsty when they took the pitchers away and forgot to return them filled. However, they kept the bread coming, which came in very handy to mop up those delicious sauces.<br><br>Atmosphere/Space: Cozy, almost verging on cramped, but it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re having a dinner party at your friend&#39;s house, so you wouldn&#39;t mind as much. The chairs get hard after 4 hours of sitting. Casual and it feels like those many BYOW (which you can do!) restos in Montreal littered across residential neighbourhoods.<br><br>Price: $90 for 7 courses with additional supplements for other courses. Very reasonable for the quality of food you&#39;re getting.\n\\\nEasily one of the most beautiful and special meals I have ever had, Edulis easily lived up to every positive review I&#39;ve read. The dishes were carefully crafted, the flavours were simple and yet stunning, and the service was beyond anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. <br><br>I could go through and list everything I ate (we ordered the seven course menu), but you won&#39;t have the same menu when you go. Some of the plates are smaller than others, but there are some larger protein dishes mixed in. Each dish was exceptional. The bread and butter are the things dreams are made of. I kept trying to remind myself not to fill up on bread, but our server refilled our bread after we finished the first basket and it was so warm and crunchy and the butter had these beautiful hints of, like, i dunno, caramel? maybe ... I can&#39;t even. <br><br>By far my favourite course was our starting course - something I can only describe as a ceviche salad with limequat. Apparently my spellcheck doesn&#39;t think limequat is a word, but wikipedia says otherwise. Anyways, it was magical. <br><br>I would like to especially thank our server, and while I don&#39;t know her name, I think if she were to come across my review she may remember us and see this particular shout out. You went out of your way to ensure we were well taken care of, especially my best friend, and I couldn&#39;t be more thankful for your hospitality.\n\\\nWe just finished a meal at Edulis. We ordered the Carte Blanche 7 course meal for $85 (everyone at the table has to order the same menu-either the 5 or 7, so no mixy matchy). We unfortunately didn&#39;t go for the truffle add-on which would have been an additional $40. <br><br>Since everything is seasonal, the menu I had will not be the same next month.

Probably not a huge value in going through each course, as the menu is set and constantly changing - but as long as you don&#39;t mind surprises and are open to eating delicious food, this place is for yoh\n\\\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways. <br>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height <br>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight...<br><br>EDULIS<br>You are my one true love. \\'a0You never let me down. Sundays are our special time together. <br>You surprise me with your amazingly sourced product, each succulent course a beautiful surprise. You tease me with your vegetables, mesmerize with your confit and sous vide and lead me into temptation with dessert. <br>I wish I had three friends to share Fr\\'e9d\\'e9ric Delair inspired pressed duck....maybe one day. <br><br>You always leave me wanting more, and sadly you are at times elusive to see and play hard to get, especially on Sundays.\n\\\nWe had the 5 course menu.

I had to come and read the reviews again in case I was missing something...<br>No, I was not. The food was just really bad. I can&#39;t, for the life of me understand the stellar reviews.<br>The food was not generous to begin with. Not only in portion size but in taste. We felt we needed salt on everything. Everything tasted stingy.<br>We had the 7 courses menu + a bottle of wine.<br>I don&#39;t think we had 100grs of protein all together...We had a lot of vegetables...either undercooked vegetables- baby zucchinis, potato, etc., or overcooked ones- tomatoes, fava beans and green onions.<br>We had small, and I mean magnifying glass needed, portions of fish. <br>We had nuts and some kind of sauce on every dish.<br>Nothing cohesive. Tastes jumped to our mouths discordantly.<br>The pi\\'e8ce de r\\'e9sistance, the last dish, a thing of squab with onion puree tasted exactly like army food...the feeling of having had too many onions...<br>I&#39;m still shocked, shocked at how bad it all was.<br>As for the service...our wine was poured way too fast, or we were ignored all together. Guests that knew the chef got &#34;special treatment&#34;, their food brought out by the chef herself. <br>We finished our bread and were not offered more. When we asked for some more, we got that, 2 pieces and no extra butter. Trust me, even after 7 courses you&#39;ll need the bread...<br>The dessert was \\'a0just sad. Blueberries that were reportedly from Ontario but tasted of nothing. Corn that was either scraped from the cob uncooked or straight from a tin, some pecans and a squirt of cream...<br>The whole evening $270. <br>Please, stay away, there are better places in Toronto.\n\\\nIf there&#39;s one restaurant in Toronto that deserves a 5+ star review it&#39;s this one.

I was in town looking for one &#34;big&#34; meal, and Momofuku Shoto was the other finalist. The fact that it was 3 times the price ($150, vs $50 for the Edulis 5-course &#34;carte Blanche&#34;) made it a pretty easy decision. I wasn&#39;t disappointed. <br><br>I arrived way too early because I was determined to leave ample time to find parking, and with good cause (residential permitting and a crowded area make parking a real challenge). When incredible luck served me up a front row parking spot, it resulted in being 50 minutes early for a 7pm reservation. \\'a0If you can find it, the parking is (amazingly) free. \\'a0<br><br>The venue is intimate, explaining why reservations are essential (weeks in advance would be wise, if not months). Tables had good spacing and this was a rare occasion where I never overheard another table&#39;s conversations (or maybe Canadians are just quieter). <br><br>Meals are not listed on a menu, or even printed each evening, because it may change patron to patron, not just night to night. Our 5 course Canadian-focused menu included 1: sashimi-fresh tuna from Nova Scotia, 2: wild Salmon from British Columbia (both beautifully presented with lots of greens), 3: an undefinable dish with a foundation of asparagus, foie gras (yes!) on toast, arugula and sliced ham, 4: quail with morels (yes!, again), and 5: a dessert with fresh berries, their juice, and a pistachio meringue (I&#39;m more of a chocolate lover, so this was the weakest link for me, but an understandable choice given the seasonality of fresh berries). <br><br>Each dish was explained eloquently, but my memory isn&#39;t up to doing justice to the complexity of each course. The summary is: fresh and fantastic, and the price is right. I&#39;d love to come back for the 7-course version (said to be equal in quantity of food, but more variety), and for the Sunday lunch (wines half price would be a pretty great deal, though pretty early to have a $50 Rioja, even for $25). <br><br>I&#39;ll conclude with a small example of what makes Edulis special: the bread and butter were so fantastic, I had to ask if there was cheese in either - it just tasted so rich and different from anything I&#39;d had before. I was told that the butter was the reason; I think it may be locally sourced, cultured, and very fresh.

There has been a fair amount of hype for Edulis and I was excited to check it out. We did the $50 carte blanche. The service was great, and they readily accepted the food limitations for each person at the table. The biggest misstep was the third course where they served us a dish they had clearly burnt. I can&#39;t believe the chef let it leave the kitchen! The other 3 savory courses were just &#34;meh&#34;. The desert, a blood orange tart, was great. <br><br>Also, don&#39;t go hungry.

For $150 a head I could have spent my money better at another restaurant. Let me preface by saying I love eating out and have no problem spending money on good food. I love truffles. This was not a truffle meal to love. Truffles were only in 3 of the 7 courses and none of the courses were delicious. I kept trying to find amazing flavor but after each bite came back bland and boring. From the first course I knew we had over paid but since we were already along for the ride I wanted my moneys worth! That did not happen. <br><br>Secondly, it took forever! Our reservation was at 7:30 and we didn&#39;t make it out until 10:45. And we did not loiter around, we wanted to get out of there! The service was slow and the meal dragged along in an uncomfortable way. <br><br>My suggestion; don&#39;t eat here.\n\\\nThe litmus test for whether a restaurant is &#34;really good&#34; or not is the question &#34;Could I make this at home if I tried&#34;. \\'a0 <br><br>If that is truly the case, then Edulis is a really good restaurant. \\'a0 \\'a0Everything was expertly prepared, delicately presented and beautifully sized. \\'a0 Staff were wonderfully attentive and pleasant beyond belief.<br><br>The problem is, the food wasn&#39;t that spectacular. \\'a0 <br><br>It&#39;s that plain and simple. \\'a0 I wish I could state it some other way. \\'a0<br><br>Sure, we LIKED it, but we didn&#39;t LOVE it. \\'a0 <br><br>Perhaps some of that was due to the human idiocy that was seated at the table beside us. \\'a0 A woman who seemed to want the whole world to know that she changes her iPhone case according to the season. \\'a0<br><br>We loved the IDEA of carte blanche. \\'a0 \\'a0Unfortunately, in practice this translated to &#34;let&#39;s feed you an orgy of meat&#34;. \\'a0 \\'a0 <br><br>Perhaps we picked an off night?\n\\\nI have been saving up my Opentable points for my meal at Edulis. <br><br>I love surprises so of course I ordered the 5 Course Carte Blanche Menu ($50).

It\\'92s a small place with a relaxed vibe which is ideal to enjoy their amazing food. Worth every penny #michelinrestaurant\n\\\nThe sauces/flavours were very vibrant every bite was amazing. The two ways scallop was my favourite\n\\\n\"Overall, I enjoyed the dinner experience, but I was disappointed about a few things. Our server was extremely kind and knowledgeable. The food was delicious, especially the scallops. However, a few cons:\\\n- There were six courses and it took 3.5 hours to get through. Way too much time would pass in between courses. In a way, it\\'92s nice because you don\\'92t feel rushed. But if you\\'92re hungry, it\\'92s pretty torturous.\\\n- We left feeling hungry. I\\'92ve never had this happen before with a tasting menu.\\\n- Dessert isn\\'92t included, which I thought to be odd given how expensive it is. They also knew the dinner was for a celebration. A complimentary piece of cake would\\'92ve went a long way.\"\n\\\nGreat food and amazing service.   Our server,  Philip,  was fantastic with explanation of courses and optional extras.  Also great at recommending wine options; when we explained a general idea what we were looking for he was able to suggest some countries and varietals we wouldn't normally try that were perfect and great with the upcoming courses. Really enjoyed the entire experience.\n\\\nLoved loved loved. A small intimate space which had lots of warmth and soul (even on a snow stormy March evening).  This was a total surprise for my birthday. It was everything I expected and more. The service was fantastic and the food impeccable.

Still absurdly fantastic, and the Michelin star hasn\\'92t changed the vibe or dishes at all. Great Canadian seafood-themed tasting menu and a fantastic wine selection. Do not miss the rhubarb dessert.\n\\\nThe atmosphere was cozy and the servers are good at what they do, but left feeling that the restaurant is both extremely overated and overpriced.

It's just delicious and exquisite xo\"\n\\\nA perfectly executed menu served by a hospitable and genuine team.  This place is full of personality. Worth the wait for a reservation.\n\\\nAnother amazing meal from an amazing staff. Easily my favorite restaurant in Toronto.\n\\\n\"Honestly such an experience. I\\'92ve personally never tried to book reservations here before, but I\\'92ve heard they go really quick. They have a release date for the upcoming month or so and you have to have reserve the date before anyone else does. Luckily, our friends were able to secure us a spot for a Friday night.\\\n\\\nIt\\'92s a very cute and intimate restaurant. I would say maybe 20-30 people could fit in here. Inside is candle lit, making it a great spot for a date (or to enjoy by yourself). They only have one seating per table per night, which is why it\\'92s probably so hard to book. It made it more special and unique because we didn\\'92t feel rushed and we could just enjoy our company, take our time eating the phenomenal food and ask whatever questions we had. The menu was also personalized with our names on it - such a nice touch!\\\n\\\nThe food itself was amazing. Each dish tasted so fresh and we loved that a lot of the seafood was sourced in Canada and the other ingredients from Ontario farms. The food was so good that it made us like and appreciate things we don\\'92t usually like (that\\'92s when you know it\\'92s really good)!\\\n\\\nEven though the food was incredible, the star of the show for me was the bread. Oh my goodness. I probably had two whole loaves to myself, not even exaggerating. It was sooo good with the butter they had, and they just kept refilling the loaf every time we finished one. I honestly wanted to bring some home.\\\n\\\nPrice wise, it seems pricier than other restaurants but you don\\'92t tip on top. So it\\'92s pretty comparable given the quality of food and service.\\\n\\\nNext time, we will try the lunch menu as we\\'92ve heard good things about it too, and it\\'92s supposed to be a different vibe.\\\n\\\nOverall, this actually ties the #1 spot for us for fine dining restaurants in Toronto!\"\n\\\nPerfection- the Sunday lunch of your dreams.\n\\\nthe price does not match the quality. do not recommend.\n\\\n\"It\\'92s incredibly disappointing to write this review, like anyone who goes out for an elevated dining experience, I wanted to be blown away and just wasn\\'92t.

A very small an intimate space that makes you feel as if you are briefly in Europe. Menu is seafood-focused and perfectly executed. Reservations are released in blocks monthly and are well worth planning ahead for\n\\\nGreat service, delicious food. I do wish, for this price, that dessert was not included (as it usually is at other tasting menu restaurants). The unlimited bread was great too\n\\\n\"After reading the many positive reviews I was expecting to be blown away but unfortunately wasn't for this season's menu. Overall, I'd say the dishes were \"\"nice\"\" and cleanly executed but nothing too complex or rich in flavor probably because fresh vegetables were used a lot. Most of the vegetables were local grown and the proteins from Europe/Canada. Perhaps this was another reason why I wasn't \"\"wowed\"\" because I grow some of the  ingredients myself such as tomatos, shiso, and other leafy vegetables, so the flavors were all too familiar for me. A fall/winter/truffle themed menu might have been better for me.\\\nThe pace of the dishes could have been a little faster but I understood that the staffing model is 4 people. There wasn't a set wine pairing menu as the menu frequently changes I was told. The wine recommended to us was good, we ordered 2 different bottles of white wines. Setting wise, it's a small rustic place and on the darker lighting side. The service was great and the waiter answered any question that we had.  If I had to sum up my overall experience in Edulis it would be \"\"nice\"\".\"\n\\\nDelicious food and exceptional service would recommend for any occasion.\n\\\nMy mouth is watering just thinking about their amazing dishes!!

Recently I ordered their take out menu (offered on the weekends) as well as some cheese and vegetables from their suppliers (all available through the online ordering portal). The food provided was phenomenal and required minimal preparations/plating on our part - including a roast duck dish that was perfectly cooked so that when we warmed it up it did not become overcooked (we were impressed!). The packaging is all compostable and included fun labels and kind notes about how to prepare the food and the sourcing of some of the ingredients.\\\n\\\nThe takeout menu is absolutely worth it and such an important way to support a wonderful restaurant like Edulis in these times.

They did a number of things right. Accommodated an infant, provided an amuse Bouche that created excitement, had a great first course of raw fish with a beautiful sear, took beef to a new level that took a type of cow that is typically not purchased for consumption, and a dessert that was complex yet simple. Finally they did a beautiful job of recognizing my birthday. Our overall service was fantastic!!!!\\\n\\\nWhat was missing or could have been improved?\\\n- the dry aged fish was missing flavour\\\n- the calamari was over cooked in some bites, perfectly cooked in others, and one of the piece was under where it had some slimyness.

Every mouthful bliss. Great service. Good luck making a booking!!\n\\\nEduils is an exceptional restaurant. The food is very good and well presented. It is cozy and not pretentious. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. I've visited more than once. I do feel that the pacing of the meal is quite relaxed and this often leads to 3 hours+ at the table, which is too long. Reducing the break between dishes by about 7-8 minutes would make it a near perfect experience, I think. That said, I sense the pacing is deliberate and not a lapse. They want you to enjoy your  company and the dining experience at an unrushed pace. For me it ends up being like a great movie that runs about 30 minutes too long.\n\\\n\"Edulis is ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Canada. I think it deserves the spot, it was a great experience and I will be returning.\\\n\\\nThe Menu:\\\nThe menu is a pre-fix menu and the dishes are not listed on the printed menu on the tables. Our host told us the dishes are frequently changed and there is a completely new menu approximately every 3 weeks. You need to be comfortable with not knowing what you're about to pay for.\\\n\\\nThere are two options you can order, a 5 course and 7 course for $65 & $85 (the prices have since gone up). We were told that the amount of food is roughly the same as the portions will be adjusted down for the 7 course meal, although you will try two extra dishes, so ordering the 7 course meal solely for the purpose of getting more food may not be a feasible option.\\\n\\\nTo start they brought out stuffed olives, house-made bread and butter.\\\n\\\nThe seven courses we tried are briefly below:\\\n1. Sashimi\\\n2. Shredded snow crab\\\n3. White asparagus and morrel mushroom\\\n4. Georgian Bay lake trout with radishes and almonds\\\n5. John Dory with muscat grapes and leeks\\\n6. Chicken stuffed with foi gras, crawfish on a push pastry, and mushroom\\\n7. Dessert came in two parts, one is a Cake with a rum syrum and creme, the other is a rhubarb frozen yogurt made with goats milk.\\\n\\\nOverall I was really happy with the menu. While the dishes are small they are very flavourful and rich, and as a result you dont find yourself wanting more. By the end of the meal I was definitely full.\\\n\\\nIn addition to the above we tried their in house made sodas. We tried the apricot and elderflower which I would highly recommend.\\\n\\\nAtmosphere:\\\nThe atmosphere is casual, and the restaurant looks like a small cottage inside and out.

The staff of Edulis leave nothing to be desired in attentiveness nor insight into the tasty variety of ingredients from varied corners of the world. All in all a uniquely delicious meal from start to finish.\n\\\n\"If you see a restaurant where it has two rooms, one is full of Asians with an Asian server and another one is full of Caucasians with a nice Canadian waitress, how would you consider this set-up? I am not talking about racism, but it is definitely not comfortable for visible minorities.\\\nThe food is not as fantastic as we expected. We have tried various tasting menus in Toronto, the taste is just a bit higher than average. I have to admit that if you like to try different things, it is a must-try place to go because of the fame.\"\n\\\nTruly a special culinary experience and one of the best in Toronto. Highly recommend prix-fixe for lunch on Sunday when wine is half price!\n\\\nGreat menu. Never disappoints. Staff are so nice.\n\\\nEvery time here is different, but every time is delicious! You definitely have to prepare yourself for a 3 hour experience, so don't come if you are in a hurry. But the atmosphere is homey, and the service is friendly. Can't wait to come back again.\n\\\nMy girlfriend and I came to Edulis for her birthday and we absolutely loved it. The food was excellent and the service was very attentive. The atmosphere and ambience is very cozy and romantic for dinner. I recommend doing a tasting menu.\n\\\nAmazing. Enough said.\n\\\n\"Currently at the restaurant. Waiting for the dessert. This is the best restaurant in the city.\\\n\\\nEdit: still the best. Kate, our waitress, was fantastic. Chef made an impromptu dinner for my mom due to her allergy. Think Ruby Watch co x3.\"\n\\\nAbsolutely one the best meals you can have in Toronto. On top of that the beverage program and service is outstanding.\n\\\nProfessional staff, had a great time.\n\\\nAbsolutely excellent dining experience, with a fantastic menu. Finally something a little different in the city. And the price point is right on. Worth every penny! If I came to the west end more often, I would make this the spot to take people. It's the first place I ever had caviar and I had no idea it was so good! Everything is here.\n\\\nCute, quaint and cozy restaurant. Love the concept of a blind menu. Even though I had no idea what I was eating, they were able to accomodate my food allergies. Food was delicious, service was attentive. I would recommend it to anyone.\n\\\nHad an amazing experience here with my girlfriend. They were so accommodating to her allergies and made sure there was no issue. The food was fantastic. The service was very professional and unpretentious. It\\'92s a steal for what you pay for. I\\'92d definitely go back.\n\\\nAmazing food.

Just make sure to plan ahead as reservations go quick.\n\\\nOne of the best food experiences I\\'92ve had! The food is delicious and beautifully seasoned with fresh herbs. The service is impeccable. The music is fab. Such a warm feeling!! Highly recommend!!\n\\\nAside from choosing what to drink, life is simple at Edulis. You\\'92ve got just the five or seven course tasters menus, and food choices aren\\'92t required. The chef does that for you. And what a chef this one is. Your sample dishes could be anything from lobster, to duck, to Arctic char, to tuna tartar ... . Dessert wound up being Baba Au Rhum and Chantilly cream. There were two of us. We got one big piece of cake on a dish which was accompanied by a vessel of the rhum concoction and another one with the chantilly cream. The Tempranillo we chose, \\'91Flor de Baco\\'92 went well with each of the foods. Oh, and if the \\'91sample\\'92 word causes you to think you might leave the place hungry, forget about it. That won\\'92t happen. We can\\'92t wait to go back.\n\\\nHighly recommend, amazing meal at a very reasonable price. Nice little restaurant serving great in-season food without any fine dining trappings. Great ciders as well!\n\\\nPricey but the food is worth it and its a sick vibe\n\\\nA true labor of love: Everything about Edulis is exceptional. The best meal I've had in Canada in recent memory, and just an all-around happy experience that I'm still smiling about. Thank you.\n\\\nI liked it a lot but others in i our party we less enthusiastic.  Menu is very original, some would say challenging.\n\\\nI took my client and his mom out to Edulis after helping him purchase a condo, to celebrate. We all ordered 7-course tasting menu, and weren't disappointed. And having been to Edulis before a few times, let my clients know that they were in for a treat. While the dishes were very good, they weren't phenomenal as I've grown accustomed to with Edulis. Id say that 4 out of the 7 dishes were great, and without remembering the exact dishes, some dishes were a tad over-salted, and some were just bland. The ambience is always great at Edulis, and we had an amazing time. Service was good, although we did wait a very long time between some of the courses, which had us at the restaurant for nearly 3 hours. But this was to be expected. Edulis has one sitting per night per table, and they make it a full nights' dining experience for all of their guests.\n\\\nFine dinning at its best... Amazing food, 5 course meal, desserts to die form.. Amazing experience, fabulous staff.... Well worth going for a casual brunch, or formal affair... Got an anniversary or a birthday... Go here.\n\\\nWe were blown away by the food and service yesterday. We've been wanting to come to Edulis for years now and finally landed a reservation on a date that worked out for us.

Philip was our server and we were the first table to be seated. He was spectacular throughout the service and provided us with an enthusiastic and informative introduction to each dish. Hands down, provided the best service we've ever had. Seated at the table next to us were a pair of regulars and we never felt neglected. The food was creative and tasted amazing. There was a skate dish that was a little too salty for my fiancee but I personally loved it. Otherwise, everything else was perfect. We'll definitely be coming back.\n\\\nA unique experience, excellent service, beautiful presentation, and exquisite dishes, you have to eat here!\n\\\nGreat meal tonight. This was our first visit in 6 or 7 years, and it was as good as we remembered. Uncharacteristically, we kept ourselves in check and went with the smaller 5 course option, which was just right. Every dish was a winner. The execution and flavour combinations were consistently top notch. Special shout out to the foie gras and sweatbreads-stuffed chicken main course, which I can only describe as having the most chicken-y rich chicken flavour I've ever tasted. Service was also great. In fact, our server deserves special mention because she was completely on top of her game despite having to deal with an obnoxious solo diner at the next table over. Will definitely return\n\\\nFantastic tasting.\n\\\nBelieve the hype.}", "doc_id": "6204b0ad-2445-4284-8289-baf54e69f25d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3940bbe398b988b5d06b9015b7e6993f99ca350281970a58708d5e757a12756e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 159056, "end": 161109}, "relationships": {"1": "f5c477a9-0b08-49a1-b864-de49d77a5a08", "2": "ff48132a-9205-4b9a-b0be-a81ab9e23fb1"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
