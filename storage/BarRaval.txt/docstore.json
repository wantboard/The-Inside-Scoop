You could easily say it&#39;s part of Spain. The tapas and the drinks really cool.\n\\\nIts a standing bar which I didn&#39;t know! The space is tight but food is decent. My favorite was the stracciatella&amp;boquerones.\n\\\nMezz was a fantastic server, the shishito peppers were sublime, and the under the bridge cocktail was absolute perfection.\n\\\nWhat a special bar!<br><br>I was able to get a high-top table at Bar Raval on a Friday night, which seemed a win in itself. I was thrilled since it was my birthday, and the vibe was just right. The cozy design, warm wood, and dark lighting make this space a perfect winter escape in the city. Monica, our server, was fantastic!<br><br>Since I have been abstaining more and more from alcohol, I was personally very excited with the mocktails that Monica continued to create for us. These bartenders are true artists, and the staff seems to be having a blast. The energy and excitement make this place a true gem in Toronto.<br><br>Though the space is tight, the free-form and organic architecture keep the space welcoming. The outdoor patio is heated and tented for winter overflow, which is great!\n\\\nExtremely cliche environment, mediocre food and drinks, awful music... honestly just a stupid internet fad. Just save your money and go to a place with more character. Details below. <br><br>First - the bar is half the size that it shows in photos.<br><br>Second - there are no chairs in the evening. You have to eat standing up. And even worse, the spots they offer you are little tiny corners that face the wall. As such, you have a bar that&#39;s filled with adults eating their food while standing, staring at the walls. Really not the ambience that you should pay $$$ for.<br><br>Third - absolutely the worst customer service ever. Staff is untrained, unprofessional, unhappy to be there, and very unclear with their instructions. They put our name down for a 45 mins wait but did not allow us to have a drink at the bar while waiting. We were asked to leave and come back, while the hostess physically escorted us outside. 15 mins later (30 mins earlier than told) they texted us to return for the table, but we had already ordered drinks at a different bar.\n\\\nFor a bar that&#39;s a part of the 50 best bars list, I was pretty disappointed. The drink I ordered was great (it&#39;s everything I like in a drink), but the service was poor. I&#39;m new to the city so I got scared to visit other bars in Toronto because of this experience thinking that I would get the same treatment.\n\\\nStumbled upon this bar on my spontaneous Toronto trip and honestly fell in love. All of our drinks were beyond our expectations, the bar is so lively( it&#39; do be a Saturday night in a college town but) and the bartenders are so graceful and considerate despite being in a buzzing environment.\n\\\nFood was delicious, not much seating but we got the patio. The food portion was a lot smaller than I expected but then it&#39;s tapas.

Once inside, I felt as if I were in another world. It was before sunset time, but the inside was dark/dim with unique indirect lighting fixtures. The space was small - it was like a hideout cave in the city :) <br><br>A server greeted us and said &#34;wherever you want&#34; - there are a few high-top tables, window counter areas, and a bar counter area with a limited number of bar stools. Essentially, it is a standing bar. All the bar stools were already taken by earlier visitors. As time passes, many people entered and grab drinks. Some are in groups, some are solo. In spite of the small size of the space and the number of people inside, I did not feel my private space was invaded by others. Maybe because of the way they arrange the lighting? Comfortable. \\'a0 <br><br>We had<br>Food:<br>(From \\'a0CONSERVAS -Canned seafood): Razor Clams \\'a0<br>(From PINTXOS - small snack) :Stracciatella &amp; Boquerones <br>(From TAPAS - appetizers) : Octopus &amp; Sobrassada<br><br>Drink:<br>- Cocktail specially made for my girlfriend&#39;s preference (gin based, fruity, and fizzy) <br>- See You No More<br>- Raval Martini<br>- Left Field &#39;Greenwood IPA&#39;<br>- Burdock APA (on tap)<br>- Estrella Damm (Spanish Lager) <br><br>We loved Stracciatella &amp; Boquerones. A layer of milky, slightly sweet, super melty fresh cheese, silky marinated white anchovy, and a thin slice of crispy bread. Enjoyed all these different textures and flavors. The refreshing parsley sauce on top perfected the dish. <br><br>Wow to the Octopus &amp; Sobrassada. Octopus pieces are hot and crisp outside but tender inside. The pieces of Sobrassada (Spanish cured sausage) transferred their flavor - saltiness, sourness, and spiciness onto other ingredients, and harmonized the taste of the dish. The paprika in Sobrassada rounded the flavor and gave it an appetizing red color.

But we were happy about our experiences there!\n\\\nI had a great time here with my friends one evening. They have tapas here with some great cocktails. Downside is you gotta grab yourself a barrel with tables otherwise it&#39;s a long period of standing. Overall it was a great experience.\n\\\nBoy has this restaurant gone down hill since we last ate there. Service was unbearably slow. Tomato bread was simply crushed tomato with no seasoning on over toasted (black), hard, inedible bread. Octopus was over cooked and rubbery. With the shrimp dish, the shrimp were tender but in a tasteless broth. We asked for bread which was brought after we finished eating. Deep fried eggplant and honey was delicious and the only redeeming food item we actually enjoyed. Basque cheesecake did not taste fresh but rather had the taste and consistency of a cheesecake that was more than a few days old.\n\\\nTwo stars were given because the cocktails might have been great. Three were removed because the service was so bad we never got to order one. <br> \\'a0I had such high expectations for this place but we were completely ignored after being seated and finally decided to just leave. \\'a0The bar itself was beautiful though.\n\\\nBar Raval is one of the most popular Spanish tapas bars in Toronto, as evidenced by it being constantly packed at any time of day (especially on weekends), and there is always a lineup. We came in the late afternoon / early evening on Saturday, and the wait for a table was about 20 minutes. They don&#39;t take reservations and there isn&#39;t a formal system for lining up, so you just have to hang around the place while waiting for a table space to open up.<br><br>Its unique interior design pays homage to the design by Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi. The interior is very small and has limited seatings. Inside the restaurant, there are small tables for standing and a few stools along the perimeter of the restaurant. They have a small patio in front that is great for the summer months. We sat at the patio and enjoyed the summer weather, very chill vibe, and nice music.<br><br>One of the things I like most about tapas is the small portions, so you can try a lot of different things. The items in &#34;Conservas&#34; section all come in tins and served with chips. For the rest of the tapas, some come with bread and some don&#39;t. The bread served in a lot of the tapas is really good - nicely toasted and crispy on the edges; some are infused with garlic.<br><br>All the food we tried were excellent. My favourites were the Squid in Ink, Razor Clams, Tomato Bread (finely diced fresh tomatoes on top of toasted bread), Mushrooms &amp; Shrimps Tower, Heirloom Tomatoes &amp; Tonnato, Octopus with Beans, and Shrimp a la Planxa (large Argentinian shrimps with lobster &amp; garlic sauce - very tasty).\n\\\nUnique tapas bar with delicious drinks. It is super crowded during the night and it was a bit difficult to get our order through.<br><br>Heirloom Tomatoes &amp; Tonnato was marked as $16 which I thought was pretty expensive for tomatoes.

I was wrong. Okay, it is still pretty pricy but we wanted to lick the plate because the dressing/sauce (?) was that delicious. Jamon Croquetas was also a decent choice. It is a creamy ham croquette with mashed potatoes. This is a tapas bar after all, so don&#39;t expect to get full after the dishes.<br><br>Also ordered several drinks and cocktails including Say Less, Magic City, and See U Never. Every drink was pleasant. See U Never was my personal favorite because I loveee the taste of yuzu and sour flavors in general. <br><br>Plus, the interior is super cool! It seemed casual yet formal at the same time. We did not really have a designated seat. Instead, about half of the people were probably standing around the big table that&#39;s connected to the wall.\n\\\nI&#39;ve been seeing a lot of reviews and blogs about Bar Raval so we decided to stop by for drinks. We initially joined the waiting list online before visiting. Once we received a text we made our way to the bar.<br><br>At first we took a seat on the very small patio outside. There weren&#39;t many available tables and shared a corner of a ledge with another couple. It didn&#39;t seem like there were waiters for specific areas of the restaurant, just random employees walking around, with no one checking in with us.<br><br>Once we flagged down a waiter, we ordered the See U Never cocktail. We also asked the waiter if it was possible to get an actual table without having to share a corner of a ledge cramped with people.<br><br>Our waiter directed us inside, where we also were cramped up with another couple sharing a ledge. We then received our drinks and took a sip and they were not very good. It tasted like the smell of dish soap and had a very strange after taste. We then asked for our bill and paid for some overpriced dish soap and went to another bar where we had a good old mojito.<br><br>I understand that Bar Raval is trying to do something a little different with their set up and have some type of Spanish influence but I don&#39;t think this is it. I&#39;ve visited Spain many times and the only thing reminiscent of the Spanish culture is the interior which somewhat resembles gaudi architecture.\n\\\nGREAT FOOD AND SERVICES! GREAT ATMOSPHERE!!!<br><br>Last 2+ years has been a tough time for many restaurants. I noticed a handful of my favorite restaurants have been closed for business since then or suffered a major drop in quality.<br><br>I feel so happy that Bar Raval has maintained its usual high standard! \\'a0Their service is still top notch, and the food is awesome as always! \\'a0I&#39;ll definitely go back often as I did before.\n\\\nI want to warn you right off the bat, this is a mostly standing bar so you need to go in with the proper expectations.

We decided to check it out and we are happy we did.<br><br>We walked in and we were greeted immediately. It was a beautiful day, so we took a small table outside. Our server came over quickly and took our drink order. I was craving a white wine and he made a great suggestion that worked well for me. We looked over the menu and decided to go with the ham croquetas and sobrassada. <br><br>Our food came out shortly and it looked great. The flavor of the sobrassada was amazing. It was fatty, spicy, umami, and incredible. It was served with toasted points and a little olive oil. We truly enjoyed it. The jamon croquetas were very indulgent. They were very cheesey and we fell in love with them. <br><br>Overall, we really enjoyed our meal. The location was amazing, service was great, and the food was on point.

The standout has to be the Mushroom Tower. Price point is about $15~ for cocktails and $15-20 per tapa sharable among 2-3. They can also add more single portions so there is never that awkward sharing moment. The cocktails are delicious, and the server will help you pick one that fits your palate.\n\\\nFood was good, but super unfriendly, snobby service. Servers act like your mere presence is a bother. Disappointing experience, won&#39;t be back.\n\\\nTried to take our party here at 7:30 on a Tuesday. We were put on an hour long waitlist which we don&#39;t mind waiting for. Once we got in we were put out on the patio at a table with no chairs. We received no service for 15mins until one of our members went to the bar to ask. After a server came we waited another 20mins a water or any drinks before deciding to just leave. We were extremely disappointed because we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere and we&#39;re pushed into a corner on a patio with no chairs. The host also didn&#39;t tell us we wouldn&#39;t have any chairs and a member of our party could not remain standing all night so if we&#39;d known then we would have forfeited the table.\n\\\nService was trash. Got a table that had no chairs. The hostess walked off and no one showed up until we walked over to the bar to flag someone down. Waited 20 minutes after our drink order and finally walked out. Got stuck in the outdoor seating which removes a lot interest in going here in the first place. We never got any sort of explanation that they were busy, short staffed, etc. So I guess this is just how they run their business.\n\\\nI came here for the first time a few days ago and I was so impressed! The drinks are amazing, the ambiance is so cozy, and the food is delicious. My friends and I were having a girls night and only intended to get drinks, but we ended up ordering the octopus &amp; sobrassada, shishito peppers, and iberico pork &amp; leeks to share. <br><br>My favorite was the octopus, they cooked it in a spicy sauce that has a little bit of sweetness to it, and you could tell it was fresh because it didn&#39;t have that rubbery consistency that it can sometimes get. They also gave us bread to dip in the leftover sauce which is always a plus!

I can&#39;t say enough how good everything tasted. Whoever is back there making this stuff is a real genius.<br><br>There&#39;s more to it than food, and everything really was great. The cocktails were crafted masterfully, everything came out at just the right time, our server gave us just the right level of attentiveness. <br><br>Only thing to be warned of, is that there could be a bit of a wait. Check the waitlist and get yourself on it before you arrive on the Yelp app. Having to wait can be less than ideal, but the hostess was magnificent. She really made us feel welcome and taken care of. The waiting list and notifications all worked out smoothly. We didn&#39;t have to wait as long as anticipated.\n\\\nTook me bf here for drinks for his bdayy and we both loved the place!

My partner and I were betting on the supposed names of the dishes we didn&#39;t know the names of: of marinated octopus and mini burgers and people watch through the carved out windows of the restaurant patio. Although there&#39;s tons of cured pork meat, expensive import tinned conservas and open kitchen tapas to try it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to come here starving, or you would easily blow $70 per person drinking and eating. I decided to try the lemonade cold brew, which was a curious mix of coffee and lemonade. Wasn&#39;t too bad but more drying than I expected. \\'a0<br><br>The tuna Gilda is hands down one of the most tender and refreshing Smokey things I&#39;ve eaten but beware, it IS $5 a stick. It comes sandwiched between spears of chilis and chunks of pickle. It&#39;s worth visiting just to try it.\n\\\nThe vibe, service and food were exceptional. Every small plate was divine. The mushroom tower was my fave don&#39;t miss that dish.\n\\\nOctopus - great Flavor, we love the hit of citrus and the bit of spice. Only problem with this dish was at the octopus for slightly dry; this could be because of over cooking in the delivery though.<br><br>Patatas bravas - these were pretty good. We liked the garlic sauce, although we wish there was more of it. We also wish the same for the tomato sauce.\n\\\nOrdered the negroni cocktail kit from bar raval and it was AWESOME!! They included everything we needed in a cute package with instructions! I loved the garnishes for the drinks, gave it that extra touch! They have many different options and I imagine they will all be great\n\\\nFor diners looking to experience the authentic flavours of Spanish cuisine, Bar Raval, a much-adored tapas restaurant in Little Italy, is a must for your next takeout order. <br><br>The menu of pays homage to Barcelona&#39;s vibrant culinary scene with a variety of simple and delicious pinxtos, bocadillos and tapas. Highlights include the jamon croquettas, hot octopus and some of the best patatas bravas in the city. Or, order a selection of meats and cheeses for your next charcuterie board, such as 18-month aged Iberian chorizo and manchego. <br><br>Don&#39;t forget to peep the &#34;weird wine&#34; section of the wine list for some eclectic pairings.

Warren Buffet said price is what you pay, value is what you get. \\'a0 Based on that advice, I&#39;d say they owe us $300 for wasting our time and overcharging for tapas that are free in Spain/Italy if you drink.

What a joke\n\\\nI won&#39;t bury the lead and say that this is my FAVORITE place in Toronto, but I read a few reviews before posting and have to start with these warnings:<br>- If you&#39;re looking for a full menu dinner option, don&#39;t come here<br>- If you&#39;re looking for a fun bar with a large group, don&#39;t come here<br>- If you&#39;re looking for quick service, don&#39;t come here<br><br>But now the good stuff...I come here for brunch...cocktails....weekend afternoon catch-ups. You name it.<br>I recommend the cava or spanish fizz if you&#39;re drinking, the Cafe Raval if you&#39;re looking for a sweet coffee drink and literally anything on the menu for food. <br>Don&#39;t sleep on the kitchen bread, boquerones or octopus a la plancha. If you can get the salted cod torte, do it!<br>The design is impeccable, the ambiance is the best in town and the staff are friendly and warm (but not quick, as previously mentioned). <br>Post COVID- \\'a0this will probably be my first stop and I&#39;ll start with a glass of Cava to celebrate!\n\\\nI loved the atmosphere. It is a small bar with an amazing decor inside, all made of wood and reminds you of the architecture in Barcelona. They have great Spanish tapas and the mixology is also remarkable. I would definitely comeback but be aware that this is mostly a standup type of bar with limited seating and this is part of the experience.\n\\\nMy favorite spot in Toronto! Their food is amazing. I wish I could have 3 orders of tomato bread ordered to my house in Los Angeles right now. You can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order. I love their Cocktails and wine selection!

We also ordered the Hot Octopus, which we like to order at nice places because we&#39;ve been chasing a really good octopus dish after having one in Philadelphia some time ago.

It was nice and warm inside. Loved it!\n\\\nWorth the hype!! Went here with my boo on Sunday night around 10:45, their kitchen is open until 2! We faced about a half hour wait on their heated outdoor waiting room, had olives and bread sooo tasty and fantastic olive oil! We were moved inside to the bar and got down to it!! We ordered a bunch but what stood out was the hot octopus (served w crispy potatoes and nice oily sauce) cooked PERFECTLY! The pintxos with \\'a0Stracciatella and these sweet fish can&#39;t remember the name... and this wonderful raw fish dish! Just soaked in olive oil served w almonds.. SO GOOD! Also had a fantastic grapefruit/espresso cocktail that I ordered three times, was so fucking good. The prices are just like any high end toronto snack bar, we each had 3 drinks and 7 dishes or so came to 250 including tax and tip\n\\\nThe food technically isn&#39;t bad it is just underwhelming. Would not recommend coming here for dinner as it is more of a cocktail bar. The menu is a tad bland.\n\\\nThis bar was absolutely fantastic. The drinks have so much care and thought put into them and it shows! Zena was amazing and recommended some great choices. The atmosphere is cozy and the interior is beautiful.

Maybe it was because of the overhype that blogTo did, but this place wasn&#39;t as impressive as what we heard of. <br><br>First of all, so many articles/blogs keep mentioning that this place has a cool interior that looks like gaudi&#39;s architecture. The place for sure has a cool interior, but I think the reason why we were a bit disappointed is because the place was a LOT smaller than how it looked like in the pictures that were posted on blogTO, hence not that much space to have that much of cool interior. We could see the resemblance of the interior of place to typical gaudi buildings, but maybe we needed to lower our expectations to have appreciated it more. <br><br>The bar itself is nice, and the food you get is tapa&#39;s style - small portion size with not THAT many varieties. Food was mostly greasy/oily for my taste, but it wasn&#39;t horrible nor amazing. \\'a0The aesthetics of the food were good. <br><br>Overall, the place wasn&#39;t bad but they didn&#39;t impress us that much. Probably will only return if the other party really wants to go\n\\\nHmmm, I have wanted to come here for a while based on the patio I guess. After finally managing to get a seat on the patio- 30 minute wait- although don&#39;t get me wrong that is what I was expecting, I have to say I&#39;m underwhelmed. I think this place falls into the category of &#34;don&#39;t believe the hype&#34; food options average and pricey, ditto for the drinks. Would I wait in line for this and the degree of pretentiousness you get from the host/ hostess and the waiter? uh.... no. Especially not when there is an equally nice patio and better selection of food options a mere one block west.\n\\\nReally nice bar/restaurant! They have tapas style food which is always fun because you get to try more of the their menu! Their drinks were good and atmosphere was nice. Beautiful woodwork decor throughout the whole bar, would definitely recommend for a nice night out!\n\\\nOver the past few months I have visited Bar Raval maybe 3 or 4 times. \\'a0And it&#39;s sad to say, but it&#39;s not the same as it used to be.<br><br>The service, for one - is not friendly. \\'a0One of the things I used to love was coming in and sitting/standing right at the bar where the action is and getting the bartender to order food and make me some drinks off-the-cuff.<br><br>Juliana used to be my go to bartender. \\'a0She used to love making me and my partner random drinks.

Brought me all the way back to Barcelona. Came here on a Friday night at 8pm and it was super packed... Had to wait for an hour before they called us. When we arrived they said they table we had was stolen?? So they gave us another side table in the corner... not the best response after we waited for so long and someone just stole our table like that and they couldn&#39;t kick them away? Definitely not like typical restaurants.. speaking of which we had to stand and there were no bar stools around. It wasn&#39;t what we expected after standing all day. <br><br>Drinks, we ordered one each. They were tasty but mine was literally filled with ice straight to the top and I had two full sips from my straw and it was empty... <br><br>Food was amazing though. The crispy eggplants were well seasoned and sweet with honey. The octopus was really good too.<br><br>Super loud and crowded. Interior decor definitely resembled those in Spain but price was expensive for small portion sizes especially the drinks\n\\\nWay too expensive way too small portions. For four of us the bill came out to 170$ before tip (only got one drink each two of which were beers) and we left hungry. Not a place for dinner. Good for drinks and some snacks but still it is expensive. The taste of the food was good and authentic (my friend is from Spain and I&#39;ve visited enough times) but we agree that it&#39;s not worth going back.\n\\\nthis place was recommended by a bartender we had at a previous location and i am so glad we walked in here <br><br>their outside area has a rustic view to it<br>tables are pretty much just barrels with a wooden table top, it was very nice <br><br>they have a lot of drinks to chose from and we also had some appetizers <br>some bread and roasted chili peppers <br>the chili peppers (i don&#39;t remember what kind of peppers) were seasoned so nicely and it paired so well with our bread and dip<br><br>if ever given the chance to come back to toronto i would definitely come back here, it was great!\n\\\nThis bar has one of the most unique bars I&#39;ve ever seen.

The bar itself is one with the wall and a shelf that is part of the ceiling. The wooden structure is aesthetically pleasing and really sets the mood for the place. We had an awesome bartender named Ash, who made great cocktails and had great conversation with us. This was the perfect stop for our mid-day. Ash was very pleasant and helped us with some recommendations for the rest of our visit to Toronto. If you&#39;re near Kensington Market or on College St, or even just in Toronto in general, I would definitely check this place out.\n\\\nOk we just got to Bar Raval &amp; and host is super rude. He was trying to tell us that we can&#39;t get a sit down table because we don&#39;t know &#34;Spanish culture&#34;. Seriously guys you need to something about this racist host!\n\\\nThe lady bartender was extremely rude - she was wearing a white shirt with stars. After spending an hour to get in she was extremely hostile and didn&#39;t seem to want to take our order. She had a &#34;regular&#34; at the bar who she was super friendly with but she didn&#39;t like that we were standing next to him and made our experience extremely unpleasant. <br><br>Go some where else to spend $40 on cocktails.\n\\\nIf an establishment claims to be a bar, the drinks shouldn&#39;t disappoint. Servers were nice and service was fast despite the establishment being very busy, but all four drinks I tried were uninteresting. There was a confused and overly sentimental new wave attachment to Vermouth. I say confusing, because the way the drinks were made seemed neither traditional nor new. New is fine, but that shouldn&#39;t literally mean inexperienced foray. New means the classics were read and thought through thoroughly, and then improved.<br><br>Is representative of Spain now or Spain decades ago? I think not.\n\\\nTrendy bar, beautiful decor. Overpriced, yes. But a great place to go on that rare occasion. Delicious tapas and yummy cocktails. One star off as I hate standing when I eat/drink as I feel like I can&#39;t relax.

Yesterday was my second time being there and by 6:00pm it was already starting to get busy! Luckily they had room for us and then we managed to grab a great table to sit at. Especially since we ordered so many yummy dishes. <br>The bartenders do not skip out on the alcohol so watch out if you&#39;re not much of a drinker. I would recommend trying everything on the menu, possibly space it out in a couple visits because you will leave feeling stuffed at the end. One thing I noticed was that the staff worked cohesively together. They were helping each other out every chance they got. It was really nice to see staff work so well together especially when it&#39;s busy. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. The outdoor patio is just as nice as the inside, affixed with cute ambient lighting and heat if it&#39;s a bit nippy outside. Thanks for being a great addition to College St. <br>At the end I was shocked with how much the bill was. It was cheaper than what I had expected so not only my tummy was happy but also my wallet! Will definitely be returning in the future!\n\\\nThis is a gorgeous, very trendy bar that also serves snacks. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for dinner since it&#39;s mostly standing room only with a few tables and stools. It&#39;s also pretty loud inside so it&#39;s hard to have a conversation. However, as a bar it&#39;s super cool. They have machine cut wood all throughout the place that makes it feel like you&#39;re in a forest.

I had the Tinto Fino and the Hot Octopus. The drink was totally unique and not too sweet. The hot octopus was so good, I wish I had more people with me so I could have tried all the tapas! A little pricey during normal time so if you can come here during happy hour that is probably the way to go.\n\\\nBar Raval is a treasure. \\'a0When we got there last night, there was a wait list to get into the main bar, but the service and food and drink is the same outside. \\'a0You&#39;re simply trading an enclosed patio for a warm wooden bar. \\'a0<br><br>The bartenders are masters at their craft and the food is delicious. \\'a0I hate tapas with a passion as a concept because it often ends up just being small portions of a dish for the price you would pay for the rest of it. \\'a0But, Bar Raval does a great job of making these plates unique and not just miniature versions of something you want to eat. \\'a0We tried the Tomato Bread, the Kitchen Bread, the Ham and Cheese croquettes, the quail with almonds and the burger. \\'a0They were all unique, but I would put the Quail at the top of list, followed by the tomato bread and croquettes, then the burger and the kitchen bread. \\'a0Please understand, these were all great and I&#39;d get them again, but if you wanted to know favorites, there we are. \\'a0<br><br>This bar doesn&#39;t need to be as good as it is.

The second that strikes you is how small the actual bar area is. I went right before happy hour and managed to nab a space at the bar along the window. People are elbow to elbow and if you don&#39;t have an uncomfortable stool to sit on you have to stand. I ordered the octopus tapas and it was pretty tasty. Got a cocktail that I can&#39;t remember the name of and that was fine as well. It was more expensive than I thought it should be and I have to say this place has more hype than substance to it. Probably wouldn&#39;t bother going again.\n\\\nOne of the best bars I&#39;ve visited in the world. Tiny and quaint with the most beautiful design and wood carvings! The food and drinks are to die for. Get the grilled octopus!!!!\n\\\nThis place brought me back to Barcelona. Except the clients. Not as loud laughed as the Spanish. The Tapas are amazing and they have 2 delicious in house alcohol free fancy drinks that will leave the non drinkers feel just as cool as the other kids. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We had the octopus (delicious), foie gras (not my favorite a bit chewy and strong grilled fat taste) manchego (delicious), Serrano ( omg) and grilled peppers (always fun). Good atmosphere but a bit tight. If you are uncomfortable being bumped into by strangers you may not like that...but I don&#39;t when people try to at least be respectful while passing by you.\n\\\nI love the concept of this place. They do have a limit on the number people they let in at a time, but it adds to the atmosphere of the establishment. I went on a Saturday night, and the place looked like it was buzzing. The nice doorman took our names, and suggested we wait at the upstairs bar next door. (The Bar next door is called LoPan. Asian inspired). It was about a 10 minute wait.<br><br>We got a text to let us know they were ready for our party. After you walk in it feels like your transported into a hobbit like work. The woodwork was BEAUTIFUL. It really added an elegance to the space. It was also set up in a way that made conversation very easy with groups of people. We originally stopped in for drinks (they were spectacular) but with the smell of food in the air we could not resist. <br><br>The women next to us was eating something that smelled amazing. After a short conversation we food out it was duck heart. I like to think of myself as an adventurous eater but something like duck hearts were new to me. THEY WERE AMAZING.

The interiors are layered with giant swirl carved woodcuts along the walls and ceiling and fitted with strategic uplighting and housing arrangements of wine bottles. Dimly lit ambiance, clearly a good date spot for 20 and 30-something professionals. <br><br>The cocktails were phenomenal and inventive. The drink menu also features a selection of Spanish vermouths which were a delicious revelation. <br><br>Oh and the FOOD! Everything is small plates to share, and we kept ordering more and more dishes as everything we sampled exceeded our expectations. Fresh oysters, thin-sliced preserved tuna jerky(?) with marcona almonds, smokey grilled mussles on a skewer, thick toast layered \\'a0with grilled peppers and anchovies, hot grilled octopus in a delectable olive-lemon sauce, and even a hamburger with a white queso. Nothing was ordinary. <br><br>Manager on duty was a bit of a snob, our waitress was lovely.\n\\\nFirst time ....first impressions. Be prepared to wait Ina cold enclosed patio for quite some time. But it is worth the wait. The indoors is lovely and the food is really good.<br><br>But .,...,...don&#39;t look up !!!!! The bottles that they use for decorations are covered in years of dust and dirt and fluff. It did make me question the cleanliness of the kitchen\n\\\nIf you&#39;re in Toronto, stop by. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Excellent old fashioned and the best &#34;warm&#34; octopus I&#39;ve ever had. I coulda sworn the bartenders Andrew and Ian owned the place by the way that cared for the place. Stop reading this and just go check it out.\n\\\nJust fantastic. As long as you don&#39;t mind sitting on stools, the tapas, drinks, atmosphere and service were great. Did not disappoint.\n\\\nFirst off, we obviously need to acknowledge how beautiful this place is and how amazing the architecture is inside. But the food and drinks is also what we&#39;re here for and let me say it did not disappoint at all. Each dish deserved a good mmm after each bite. It is a little pricier, but worth coming with a couple friends and trying several dishes!\n\\\nI cannot speak to the food, which I&#39;m sure is phenomenal. But this place was super chic.

For cocktails, we started off with Pollard Punch, then Baby Duck, Malibu Barbie, and Toasted Rice. \\'a0For food, we enjoyed every morsel of Hot Octopus, Hamburguesa, Garlic Sausage and Cabbage and Mushroom Tower. Andrew is a talented mixologist creating these unique cocktails. We haven&#39;t heard of a lot of the liquor described in the drink menu, but we&#39;re glad we tried several different drinks, they were well balanced and formulated beautifully. As for the food, the chefs take such care in charring our octopus, and each leaf of the cabbage to go with the nicely grilled sausages. The two different pickled peppers in the Hamburguesa were such fabulous choices, it reminded me of a Cubano. And then there was the Mushroom Tower--every element were cooked with such care, down to the crisping of the crust of the baguette, to the saut\\'e9ed mushrooms bursting with flavor as you bite into them and the tender shrimp that garnishes it. We asked for the check and to our surprise, Andrew showed up with a complimentary cheesecake and two shots of Lustau Sherry because Trevor knew we were celebrating our anniversary. The cheesecake was so light and fluffy and the Sherry went so well with it. That&#39;s the thing, they make great food and drinks and they know what flavors compliment each other. You can tell they all enjoy what they do and they enjoy serving their customers. It was a night we will never forget. Can&#39;t wait to try other drinks and tapas.\n\\\nIt&#39;s been YEARS since I came to Toronto for the first time and I searched &#34;top bars&#34; in my area and this is what came up. I&#39;m a sucker for cute little places like this so me and a few friends had to try! <br><br>Have to say we were thoroughly impressed! I tend to shy away from large crowds and this place sure was packed... almost to a fault. The wait time was less than desirable but you know what, with tapas like these I could totally understand! I had the fried eggplant with honey and then (I&#39;m ashamed LOL) but I also had the shrimp with scallops. Both dishes were great, but I haven&#39;t had better shrimp in years. <br><br>The service was... OKAY, but I used to be a server a few years ago in college and when you have a crowd like this place had... there&#39;s only so much you can do! <br><br>All together, I&#39;d definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to grab a drink and have a good platter with some friends! Just be okay with a crowd and a little wait time!\n\\\nLove this place, especially for brunch. Great selection, free oysters sometimes. Magical service, attentive without making any sort of production out of it, and no matter how busy, you get to linger. A special spot.\n\\\nInteresting tapas bar with exquisite carved interior woodwork and plaster work. Excellent cocktails served with fresh ingredients and good quality spirits. We sampled the sardines, grilled and pickled octopus, and tomato bread; all were excellent.\n\\\nThe tapas are great and I love the variety that they have.

They don&#39;t take reservations so you want to try to come during the weekdays or off-peak hours. During the winter they have heated seating outside as well.<br><br>If you&#39;ve never been and enjoy trying new flavors, I would recommend stopping by here, but definitely not on a weekend! To be fair I&#39;ve never had to wait in line for this place as I come between lunch/dinner during weekdays only. Would not be worth a long wait in my opinion.\n\\\nLiked it. But didn&#39;t love it. You all know I loathe hipsters and this is what&#39;s kept me away from this place. Also, the lack of comfortable seating. Overall, I found the food to be good, but nothing I couldn&#39;t make at home (with the exception of the tinned seafood. Honestly, though? I thought the tuna tasted like rio mare. Shishito peppers were good, but any sucker can get a dry pan and some sea salt and blister those puppies up. The bread with roasted red pepper and anchovy was good, but I could assemble the same thing from my pantry. Cauliflower with anchovy, chilli, capers and garlic was a flavour bomb, but as predicted--- not rocket science to replicate at home. The duck heart was very yummy. I was lucky that no one was adventurous enough to make me share.

We got a space to stand near the window as this place is severely lacking in seating of all kinds - chairs, stools etc. Waiter was ok, and left so abruptly after our drink orders even though we wanted to order tapas that we decided to go somewhere else after.\\\n\\\nGreat, just 2 cocktails, no problem right? Waited 40 minutes because there was only ONE bartender working on the busiest day of the week.\\\n\\\nDrinks were pretty good, interior is warm, with Gaudi-like Spanish design. Other than that, this place is so outdated, overrated, and overpriced. Almost $50 for 2 drinks? Not worth it. Skip this one.\"\n\\\nFun place for drinks and yummy tapas!\n\\\nCame by for after dinner drinks and so sad we were too full for more food because the nibbles were so good (Get the Stracciatella & Boquerones!) Our server Holly gave us great recommendations and was super sweet! Busy standing only bar but we put ourselves on the nifty waiting list while on the train and got a table by the time we arrived. Great way to end an evening :)\n\\\nDidn't serve Caesars, ok fine. But I would suggest avoiding this place: they have no security and were giving out drinks to visibly intoxicated customers until they started harassing my party. Very gross.\n\\\nThey sell their excellent bread!\n\\\nI wanted to like this place but it's overrated. The food was sooo salty and just ok. The chairs are so uncomfortable but the worst was the service. The waiter was kind of aggresive at some point when I asked for the bill. I got scared for a second. He also got annoyed when we asked him for water. He did not want to be there for sure.\n\\\nDrinks were pricey compared to other pubs on area.\n\\\nFavourite bar in Toronto.

I started coming last year and it\\'92s such a nice place to stop into. My friend and I came on Easter Monday and we were happy that it was open. It was one of those beautiful spring days so we stood on their patio.\\\n\\\nThis cocktail was just perfect! Made with gin and citrus with the cutest garnish too. We also got their tomato bread for a snack :)\"\n\\\nThe bartenders here are not only pretty but also super professional \\uc0\\u55358 \\u56691  the cocktails are fantastic\n\\\nLoved the place,  the food & the wine,  the atmosphere,  the friendly staff\n\\\nWe had a delightful night made better by the beautiful evening weather and the other patrons. The wait staff was exceptional.\n\\\nThe vibe is great however the food is a little bit expensive for what it is!\n\\\nAmazing bar to go for drinks & great atmosphere. Staff are great and very good at their jobs\n\\\nFantastic service, warm atmosphere, and delicious food! Thought the mushroom tower was a bit overrated, but other than that everything was fantastic.\n\\\nThe smoking gun cocktail alone is worth visiting for a drink.\n\\\nBar Raval was everything I dreamed of and more in a cocktail bar! The interior is in an absolutely stunning art nouveau style and the service was impeccable. My partner and I had a few cocktails each of which were unique and flavourful. Definitely recommend the smoked makarel too!\n\\\n\"Firstly, the bar itself is beautiful. The cocktails are fantastic and the vibe is great, anytime of day. Still rating Raval four stars as I've been going there for years and do really like it, but do want to express an opinion on the lack of seating that was introduced (not sure when this happened, haven't been to Raval in maybe a year until this week) - there were only a few stools in the bar area and it was quite humorous watching people coming in, looking for a seat, having to ask, being told it's a 'standing only' bar, and then they would either leave or look highly annoyed but stay. I asked the bartender about this decision and he explained to me that 'tapas bars in Spain are standing only\"\" and said they're trying to 'cultivate that' here. I find this a bit silly for a few reasons -\\\n1. I've been to both Barcelona and the Basque Country several times, and can safely say that 90% of the places I went to offered seating. If they didn't, they allowed and/or encouraged you to take your tapas/pintxos out into the square outside to eat, where most Spanish/Basque people were sitting and enjoying their food and drinks. Also, the reason that some people would stand and eat in Spain/Basque is because the true culture is visiting several tapas bars in one evening, usually having a couple tapas and a glass of wine and then moving onto the next. So it makes sense that you might stand and eat if you're spending just 20m at one spot. Clearly that is not", "doc_id": "90001386-33d4-4f9d-97b7-17ac50cb727b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1f62a3455574e1af39c69bc83e1d85ba8c85a1fd6a259e3f67fbc40413a80f40", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 85673, "end": 89475}, "relationships": {"1": "55655802-afa2-47c4-bb30-9061752d32b9", "2": "877b88e9-e929-4be2-ab17-56a385a3ffb9", "3": "c4c4b904-2986-4af7-b6ca-7cffe9a443bc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4c4b904-2986-4af7-b6ca-7cffe9a443bc": {"__data__": {"text": "only\"\" and said they're trying to 'cultivate that' here.

So it makes sense that you might stand and eat if you're spending just 20m at one spot. Clearly that is not the case for College st. in Toronto ha so also the logic is very off\\\n2. I can somewhat see the 'standing only' vibe working at night, when people are stopping in for an hour for a drink and a snack, but it felt *very* odd at 3pm when I stopped in. People wanted to read, chat to a friend, etc, and it's just not comfortable to stand while doing those activities\\\n3. Ya can't force a vibe. Toronto folk want to sit down. Give the people what they want. It reeks of someone's \"\"vision\"\" vs actually thinking about the customers who would be visiting and their enjoyment. It would be like a Toronto coffee shop trying to force people to sit and have an espresso in the morning at the bar - sure, it's a nice idea and that's how they do in Italy, but....this isn't Italy\\\n4. Borrowing one part of the culture whilst ignoring the less convenient parts is a bit troublesome, no? Tapas/pintxos in Spain and the Basque region cost on average 1-3 Euros (max $4-5 CAD), glasses of wine even at the most popular bars in Bilbao were around 4-6 Euros (max $9-10 CAD). At the most popular local spot you could get a nice glass of Rioja for $3. The idea is that people can chat with their friends, kick off their evening or have a snack in the afternoon, and do so affordably. Understood there are import costs and other challenges to opening a spot like this in Toronto - the cost itself isn't really my complaint, it's more the \"\"cultivating\"\" of a select part of the culture and ignoring the less profitable ones. I don't want to be standing for 3 hours with a sore back and then also paying $100 for a couple drinks and snacks - that is absolutely not the 'Spanish tapas bar experience\"\"\\\n5. If you don't want people sitting down and that's gonna be the final decision, just remove the stools altogether. The standing folk were watching those of us blessed with a stool with eagle eyes until we left so they could nab them lol it just causes confusion\"\n\\\nBeautiful spot. Great service. Needs more stools.\n\\\nKitchen toast for the win!\n\\\n\"The stracietella & boquerones were SO GOOD. Simple yet sooo flavorful.

Just be prepared to stand as that\\'92s the vibe\\'85\n\\\nI was surprised that it\\'92s a standing bar and was too crowded. Loved their drinks though.\n\\\nWouldn\\'92t be my first choice, it\\'92s very small, no reservations and hardly any chairs unless you manage to get one of the 6 seats at the bar. The drinks and apps are really good and the interior is lovely!\n\\\n\"I tried some tasty things at Bar Raval this weekend and it was such a nice tapas journey.\\\n\\\nWe started with the jamon croquetas which were comfort food heaven in one or two bites. It gave me fancy scalloped potato vibes and I could have eaten a plate full of these. We then had the tomato bread which I thought fell flat but I think it was just the tomato that was used. The stracciatella & boquerones pintxo which is pictured, was heaven. The sardines, burrata and parsley oil drizzle was perfection together. We then had the chistorra and quail egg pintxo which was another perfectly balanced dish. I loved the heat and acidity and I don\\'92t actually like chorizo sausage but the way they prepared it was delicious. We then had this to die for pork dish with black truffle that had a sauce I couldn\\'92t stop smearing my bread in. We were full at this point but if the food was this good, I had to try the basque cheesecake. It was one of the best I\\'92ve had, nearly all of them are overdone and flat flavour wise. This was the perfect texture and every bite was pleasant.\\\n\\\nThe cocktails I tried were good and bitter forward. I had a glass of red from Portugal but I\\'92ve had many better Douro reds before and didn\\'92t love the one on the menu.\\\n\\\nThe vibe is modern art nouveau and you can\\'92t help but look at every richly designed corner while you sip and eat.\\\n\\\nMy only real complaint was the front of house service which was just a lot of wandering. We would have spent more on drinks but weren\\'92t asked and it was difficult to get their attention.\\\n\\\nBar Raval - 4/5\\\n\\\nFood - 4.5/5\\\nVibe - 5/5\\\nService - 3/5\\\nPrice - $$$/$$$\"\n\\\nI went to this bar as it is meant to be one of the best bars in Toronto\\'85. and I\\'92m sorry but this is not the case!

At some point after our round of drinks, one of the servers was incredibly rude to my guest and then generally to the table. Completely unacceptable given that they decided to force the 20% tip on us without mentioning it from the beginning. Would never recommend this place to anyone.\n\\\nThe drinks are amazing and it's a really nice atmosphere. However, we we had to wait over 20 minutes for a staff member to come around  to order a second round of drinks and the bill. Not the place to come to if you have a schedule.\n\\\nThe kitchen is open late on Sundays which is pretty rare, and the food is excellent. Highly recommend the mushroom and shrimp tower!

Mostly standing room, we went into their covered patio because it was less crowded and it was totally warm enough on a February night.\n\\\nFantastic. Tapas and cocktails, some of the best I\\'92ve had anywhere much less Toronto. Ask the barman for a \\'93Derek\\'94 a genius play on a Manhattan using bourbon and port and sherry.

It was about annoying to have the severs trying to clear our plates when we weren't finished. I was a bit taken back with the server bringing the bill when we didn't ask for it and we're considering staying longer (we had already placed several orders by then). If that wasn't annoying enough, the fact the server came as said she has told other guests that she had a table for them assuming that we would leave and that she would really appreciate if we could move to another spot, was so poor. We were standing up the entire time... What difference does it make if we move to another spot to continue to stand? My friend and I felt rushed and left the place. It's never a good feeling to be welcomed and then given the impression that you're a nuisance because you take your time conversing while eating tapas.\n\\\nNeeds no introduction. No one does Spanish tapas like raval. Authentic to their core, including their architecture, tells you a lot about their attention to detail.

The architecture inside the bar is so cool. Highly recommend the Spanish Fizz and the Happy Medium.\n\\\nAmazing food and beautiful architecture. The service was great as well. The only thing is that portions are a little small and not very filling. Other than that, I love this place!\n\\\nGreat ambiance, vibes, and pork iberico was delicious.\n\\\nBesides being the most visually pleasing bar, the staff are incredible. @elise.h3 kills it everytime.\n\\\n\"From the start, Chris was a disinterested and disengaged server. We entered Bar Raval upon a clearly very busy night, and were treated like a nuisance. I\\'92ve been a loyal customer since its opening and it\\'92s very sad to see how the service has devolved.\\\n\\\nWe ordered kitchen bread which fell on the floor on the way to our table (no problem, it\\'92s a tight space!) but after a long wait, it become apparent we would not be receiving a replacement. I asked the server about when we could expect it, and was met with a snide brush-off. After about 5 minutes, we were served with burnt kitchen bread from the manager who said it would be comped.\\\n\\\nAll in all, it appears Bar Raval has let their popularity go to its head and service/food quality fall to the wayside. I hope they can turn it around!\"\n\\\nInside is cool, drinks are mid, none of the table have seats or stools.\n\\\n\"Very loud, dim, crowded, and maybe 8 stools for the whole bar. You'll be standing for your meal.\\\n\\\nThat said, food was amazing and the cocktails were fantastic. I just couldn't enjoy it.\"\n\\\nAmazzzing foood but it\\'92s like a traditional Spanish bar with only standing tables\n\\\nOut of the bars I've tried in Toronto, this is definitely no. 2. The drinks were great the price is not too bad. It's all standing but doesn't get crowded due to cap on no. Of people. We had a 1hr wait to get into this place. Get here early, or reserve or be ready for 1hr ish wait. The signature cocktails are quite good, we tried Agua Benta which is kind of a sour-ish and Norman Foster which is very boozy strong drink.\n\\\n\"The waitress Lauren or Mauren (can\\'92t remember her name) gave a poor service and make us feel humiliated.\\\n\\\nShe was rude and respectful. She passed between my friends without asking gentle permission so many times, interrupting our conversations, and lastly when we asked for the bill she never asked for splitting the bill, so of course we asked for that and her face changes and almost bit my friend arm just to fix the account. Extra: we asked to talk with her supervisor and she challenged my friend saying for what reason or purpose. So we couldn\\'92t talk with nobody to tell the situation.\\\n\\\nRather than that food is good and the wine selection is good too. And I\\'92m giving 2 starts just because they accommodated the table for us since I have issues with my knees.\"\n\\\nThe atmosphere was great the tastes for marinated octopus and Stracciatella & Boquerones were good, however the food was in very small portions.
