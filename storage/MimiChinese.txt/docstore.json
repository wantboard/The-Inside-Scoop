Highly recommend \\u55357 \\u56397 \n\\\nFirst time dining experience - sat at the bar & did the Chef\\'92s choice menu - highly recommended! Amazing quality, kind and friendly bartenders, flavour profile and presentation were phenomenal! Overall a great atmosphere! We would definitely go back.\n\\\n\"My party of six and myself dined at Mimi yesterday at 5:45. We all ordered the Chef\\'92s tasting menu.\\\n\\\nAs of this morning, all six of us have terrible food poisoning. All of us agree this is the worst we have all ever had food poisoning. Not sure what the \\'91chef\\'92 did but this is so unacceptable from a restaurant of Mimi\\'92s  status. For the price we paid, honestly - cleanliness should be something they prioritize. Gross.\"\n\\\n\"We were initially quite disheartened upon arrival when the manager informed us that they had a limit of 1 bottle corkage per table (we had brought 2 bottles and were more than happy to pay corkage) but our server was attentive and they brought us some bottles that were interesting and off the wine list. However, everything was marked up like crazy. The Vincent Girardin Santenay we ended up ordering was marked up 6x from the AbV licensee price ($74 bottle listed for $455).\\\n\\\nThe food and the service was excellent, however. I would consider going back if they changed their corkage policy. Charge $75 or $100 per bottle. But don\\'92t mark up your wines 6 times!!\\\n\\\nIn terms of dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Scallops ceviche, Dumplings in Red Oil, Truffle Turnip Cakes, Char Siu and Hunan Chili Sea Bass.\\\n\\\nYou can get a similar food quality experience at a much more reasonable price if you go to Moon Palace downtown. Service and ambiance won\\'92t be as good as Mimi, though. Mimi seems to be aiming for the tourist, scenester crowd rather than looking to establish a loyal client base from the area. \\'91Tis a shame.\"\n\\\nBest Chinese food in Toronto.

My personal favorite is definitely the four foot noodle.\n\\\n4 stars for the vibe and the amazing staff that tell you in great detail about the food you\\'92re eating. They are all very pleasant and experienced. The food overall was average. The fat noodles are a bit overrated I felt but the supreme rice, char sui and dumplings were pretty good. It is a nice vibe for a casual weekend dinner. The decor is dim lit and we got a table right by the kitchen which was a great view. Had a good time.\n\\\n\"It\\'92s worth fighting for your life to get a reservation -_-\\\n\\\nGreat service, the specials are always a hit. Loved the trout <> caviar.\"\n\\\nThe meal surpassed all my expectations. I\\'92ll admit that I was drawn in by the belt noodle, and while that was really good, it wasn\\'92t the best dish of the night. The sea bream appetizer was absolutely amazing. But the best item of the night was the morel mushroom and tofu in \\'93red sauce\\'94 special they had. And I\\'92m so glad I was able to dine there when they had this. I love morels and this was a take on them I haven\\'92t seen before, putting them in an almost sweet/spicy sauce on top of fried tofu. Excellent. And to finish I ordered the black sesame ice cream on a last minute whim and I\\'92m so glad I did. Black sesame is hard to perfect the flavor and they got it right along with the puffed rice element added.\n\\\nWe notified the restaurant that we would be late for our reservation and we were totally fine when they let us know that we would be eating into our 2 hr window, as we were simply going for a quick bite. Our server/food runner kept coming to our table and asking for \\'93audience participation\\'94, which at first we didn\\'92t know what that meant because we didn\\'92t order the popular noodle dish where they show you how long the noodle is.. but then he made it very apparent he needed us to clear the table for him. This happened twice throughout our hour stay and was kind of unenjoyable to interrupt our dinner to get us to make space on the table for him. At 7:25pm (1.5 hours into our reservation) we asked for the dessert menu and were reminded again to that we had to leave at 8pm and that was we had 30 minutes. We understood we were late and respected that we had a shorter reservation window. The entire time it just felt like the staff was annoyed by us for showing up late and were totally not personable at all compared to two months ago when we came. Great experience the first time round but today the service fell short and the food was mediocre.\n\\\nWonderful experience here.

The decor and ambiance is lovey. The restaurant played 90\\'92s hip hop which I loved as well. Ordered the 4 foot noodle, turnip cakes, peppered beef, fried chicken and mango pudding. The turnip cake, beef and mango pudding were the best dishes, but over priced for what you get. The fried chicken was fun to eat, like a scavenger hunt, but the flavor was nothing spectacular. The noodle was actually not good, it was thick and kinda sour in flavour. Definitely a gimmick dish. What kind of annoyed me is that I ordered a ginger-ale, which was mostly ice, asked for a refill and was charged for two drinks ($16 total for about 1 can of ginger-ale!) You would think with a dinner bill over $300 for two ppl, they could at least give you a free refills on pop! Lol. Won\\'92t be going back here again.\n\\\n\"First time dining at Mimi Chinese.

However, was very disappointed by the flavour of the food. We ordered the noodle belt, shrimp toast, crispy chicken, and cabbage. Unfortunately the noodles as well as the chicken were very heavily salted. I do love salt but the rest of the flavour was lost in the amount of salt and it became inedible. I see amazing reviews about the food so it is disappointing as I was really looking forward to it and we must have had a one off. We let our server know asking if this is supposed to be the flavour profile but he let me know it shouldn\\'92t be that salty. They brought out a cucumber salad for me to help with the flavours but the more I ate the noodles and chicken the saltier it became. Very disappointed as I left hungry and with high blood pressure. Service was great and the ambiance was lovely.\n\\\nAmazing. The hidden crispy chicken is amazing. The belt mood should never be missed.

Serving is good for 1-2 but everyone had a chance to get a spoonful to try\\\nMango Pudding - this is probably the top one that our table highlighted! I saw some reviews saying they were underwhelmed by this so I didn't have expectations but just ordered it anyway since I wasn't sure about the serving of these dessert items & just preferred to have more than less for the table to enjoy.\"\n\\\nDelicious food and Jay was just the best waiter!\n\\\nAmazing food!!! I have never had Chinese food that tasted this good. Their shrimp toast, smacked cucumber salad, steamed cake was unbelievable! Will definetely be coming back\n\\\nI wish I had come here sooner! The service was amazing. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were super knowledgable! Food and drinks were amazing\n\\\nIncredible experience, food and service! Can\\'92t wait to go back!!!\n\\\nEverything about this place is great. Went as a group of five and had a bunch of dishes. Everything tasted so good and the portion sizes are great for sharing. My highlights were Baijiu Cocktail (Jungle Panda), cucumber salad, turnips with truffle, charred cabbage, black pepper beef and 4-feet noodles and my favorites were stuffed chicken wings and shrimp toast. Tried two desserts as well- steamed cake and sesame ice cream..\n\\\nImpressive menu and execution of regional Chinese dishes. We loved the Shrimp Toast, Sea Bass and Char Siu. Creamy steam cake dessert was to die for! Bravo!\n\\\nExcellent experience - fantastic food and sake recommended by our server and sommelier. Trendy spot with positive vibe.\n\\\nAbsolutely fantastic team of staff. Everyone from the hosts to the servers went above and beyond. Special thanks to Blaise, our bartender who was attentive, knowledgeable and made some of the best cocktails in town!\n\\\nMeh. Over rated plain Chinese food just served fancy.

Thank you for a wonderful meal.\n\\\nThere is a lot to like about this place. The service was outstanding, and the overall vibe/decor of the restaurant was amazing. For the food, we enjoyed most of the dishes- standouts for us were the shrimp toast w hot mustard, and the mapo tofu. We didn\\'92t really enjoy the char siu, and the dumplings weren\\'92t anything special- the oil that they were served in could have benefited from a bit more heat. The 4ft belt noodle was a fun dish- I enjoyed the theatrics of our server stretching it out before cutting it into serve-able pieces. The noodle was also cooked to al dente perfection. Overall an enjoyable evening.\n\\\n\"It was my first time at MIMI Chinese and the food was incredible! We were a party of 3 and ordered 6 dishes which was plenty of food.\\\n\\\nMy favorite was the vegetable side of cabbage- the charred cabbage- it was so flavorful and the texture was so interesting. Definitely order it!\\\n\\\nNone of the dishes were bad, I enjoyed them all. The main chicken dish with the chilies was good (and served with 199 chilis which maybe you are supposed to eat? If there was any complaint I thought they shouldn\\'92t have served so many chilies because it was hard to pick the chicken out of it! The four foot long noodle was tasty, they demonstrate its length and then cut it up into more manageable pieces before eating. We also got the shrimp toast which also had a lot of flavor and great variety of texture- both soft and crispy!\\\n\\\nOverall a really pleasant time- hope to come again!\\\n\\\nGrant\"\n\\\nThis is my second time dining at Mimi Chinese, love the food & ambience. The food portions are great, got the tasting menu. Definitely can\\'92t leave without eating the dessert.\n\\\nCame here during the holidays with my husband.

Hot pot didn\\'92t come in an actual hot pot or any kind of stone bowl\\'85 wasn\\'92t even steaming on the plate\\'85 for $40 there\\'92s really no excuse especially considering the portion size is   also terribly small. Not even enough for two people. Fried rice was cold (perhaps pre-made), and cocktails were meh. Left still hungry after ordering 3 items, one cocktail, one mocktail for $150 + tip. Service was a little bit too active and in your face. To be frank though, I felt like this place was a crime against Chinese food AND especially middle-class, immigrant family owned Chinese restaurants that serve way better (and hot lol) food for a fraction. This place borderlines exploitation, especially how it looks like a nightclub inside but at the same time is seeking to sell itself as authentic.

The setting and vibe is very chic inside. Overall, the food was very good with nice plating. I guess my expectation was just a bit too high for the restaurant after hearing amazing things about it (also the price point). Still would recommend this spot for any couple or group of friends celebrating a special occasion! Make sure to get the noodles and shrimp toast.\n\\\n\"Mimi Chinese\\\n\\\n4.5/5\\\nMy fav \"\"high end\"\" feeling restaurant I've experienced in the city so far. The dishes themselves were very fun, particularly the hidden chicken dish which was sort of an interactive eating experience. The stuffed chicken wing gave me Shokugeki no Soma vibes (iykyk), and it felt odd (in a good way) eating a boneless wing. The dumplings were fine, nothing to complain about but not as good as the chicken wing imo. The Char Siu was fatty, balanced by the honey glaze that covered it. I thoroughly enjoyed testing my chopstick ability on the soybeans at the bottom of the dish. I wish there was more glaze tbh because it was tasty and also because I think the richness of the pork needed to be cut further. The hidden chicken I mentioned earlier was also great, fried well and covered with a savory/spicyish seasoning. It was fun digging through the chilis on top to get to the pieces of chicken hidden under. The drink I got was \"\"martini-like\"\" according to our waiter, and I found it to be awful for my taste. BUT the waiter did warn me before I ordered it and while I ordered it, so I guess I'm just not a martini person, . The service was friendly and all the waiters and waitresses were knowledgeable about the menu and inspiration behind it.\"\n\\\nExcellent atmosphere. Fantastic service.

So friendly but not overbearing.\\\n\\\nThe food was mediocre. It claimed to be authentic chinese cuisine but It lacked flavour. The noodles were bland. The cabbage was far too salty and the chicken was dry. The savior was the pork belly which was stunning.\\\n\\\nI tried their other restaurant Sunnys in Kensington shortly after and it was far better.\"\n\\\n\"I came here with some friends and got both the tasting menu and the sake paring. The food is good with some innovative hits, such as the scallion ginger scallops and hidden crispy chicken. Other dishes that wowed me include the shrimp toast and the stir fried a-choy. The sake pairing was also good, especially the sweet plum wine for dessert.\\\n\\\nMany of the dishes (such as the smacked cucumber salad, the supreme fried rice, and the hunan sea bass) aren't really innovative and can be had at many other Chinese restaurants, usually at a fraction of the price they're charging here.\\\n\\\nThe restaurant is also very dark, which is a nice ambiance but I feel it really hindered the service, as there were many servers (all dressed in black). Servers kept bumping into one another and we also had a server bring us the wrong dish by accident.\\\n\\\nOverall this is a cool place to try with friends (bring at least 3-4 friends so you can experience more dishes) and while I do appreciate Chinese cuisine being elevated to fine dining, much better food can be had at a much cheaper price in Markham restaurants.\"\n\\\nA wonderful experience from the moment we walked in! Very friendly and accommodating staff. Food was next level. The yellowtail, dumplings and house char siu were incredible. Very much looking forward to returning to Mimi in the future. Thank you to David and the team!\n\\\n\"Probably the highlight of my year \\uc0\\u55358 \\u56698  my sister and I have been wanting to come for a long time and we finally made it. Had to make reservations and luckily we were able to just the night before, and they also implement a 2 hour seating limit (but we stayed maybe like 15 min past). We ended up getting the chef's choice menu for $110/person, in which you get a four course meal and each course comes with more than one dish (except dessert which only had one). We chose to be surprised by what would be offered and I think this is the way to go, especially when you know everything on the menu is gonna taste good anyway. You do get a couple options for two courses, for example to pick between a spicy and non-spicy dish.\\\n\\\nI won't spoil what they offer in the chef's choice (but I mean you can also just look at the pics) but I will say that I'm very happy with the options they provided. I was also surprised to be super full by the end of it (had to unbuckle my pants + we had leftovers) so don't worry about leaving still hungry.

I gotta say, I never expected to hear 90's hip hop classics during dinner in a place like this.  That made it even better.  Our waitress was fantastic and the food was outstanding.\\\nThe atmosphere and decor was great.\\\nDefinitely recommend.\"\n\\\n\"I love innovative Chinese food and I try to go to every single one of them in Canada. First time visiting this spot, got their chef's menu.\\\n\\\nTaster: The chicken and ham soup was so good. Full of umami... Can I order this by itself please?\\\n\\\nStarter: The shrimp toast was the best one, even tho I usually don't like stuff covered in sesame, the flavors are just so balanced that I can't fault it at all. Chill oil tossed wonton was also very good, liked the taste of their chill oil. Scallop would have been my favorite one because the scallops were absolutely tasty, but the deep fried onion on top made it very greasy and because it was soaked in oil, it covered up the freshness of the scallops.\\\n\\\n2nd round: Pork, simply delicious. Only wished there'd be more of it. Wood ear mushroom and cucumber, I've eaten this dish so many times but their version was the best! The topping was so well balanced it was a 10/10. Rice, an usually overlooked part for Chinese food, theirs was really good, only there wasn't enough dish so by the end I was eating pure rice. Noodles, the most underwhelming dish of the night. Mine was undercooked... Also I don't think it was hand made because it had even thickness and was pretty thick, almost felt like it was made out of a pasta machine.\\\n\\\n3rd round: Everything was pretty good, especially the fish.\\\n\\\nDessert: Perfect course to end the experience. Both sesame ice cream and the sauce was delicious. Most importantly it was not too heavy and not too sweet.\\\n\\\nI also got a mocktail but it was meh, not that good.\\\n\\\nService was pretty good. The servers were attentive and listened to our requests. And I really like their service style: some dishes are served together while still maintaining the course meal format. And whoever is available brings your food but not necessarily your table's server. They really took the best part out of the Asian style service.\\\n\\\nThe environment was a bit noisy cuz of the music and it was too dark for me to see the menu. I only cared about the food tho so it was fine by me.\\\n\\\nOverall a good experience. I'm Chinese and I think they did well in both authenticity and innovation.\"\n\\\nMany choices and options... servers were well informed, courteous and helpful.

Everyone is so nice, and THE FOOD WAS TO DIE FOR!!!! Seriously, the best meal I have ever had, and the best servers. Would definitely come again, I recommend the pork belly\n\\\nFamily of 3 with a 12 year old (I would say best to go on the early side if dining with kids). We all loved it. The main dishes they are known for: Shrimp toast, House Char Siu, Four Foot Belt Noodle, Supreme Fried Rice. Can't go wrong with those. We also got the Sea Bream which was nice, and the deserts was great. People in the reviews are complaining about pricing, but inflation has driven everything and all restaurants up, and we all left very full and happy, service was excellent and atmosphere was cool. Really interesting drink menu, enjoyed the panda and sake. Lots more to explore next time on that front. Definitely recommend.\n\\\nIf you are asian, this is a three star place due to the price. While the food is good and slightly edgy, it's not good enough to justify the price charged. If you are less familiar with Chinese food then this is a pricy but a hip and delicious place to check out. I wish the restaurant was a bit quieter.\n\\\n\"Went for dinner, the food, absolutely incredible!\\\nAll the portions are definitely sized for sharing as the menu says. The service is more relaxed. It's not the type of place for a quick bite. Our waitress was super polite and helped us with the menu, making a few suggestions. The bar staff is unbelievably knowledgeable. We asked to be surprised with something not too sweet and spirit forward. What we got was something so incredible that we did it again. Couldn't even tell you what it was called, but it's definitely worth the risk. We definitely got carried away with trying a lot of food and the drinks, but if you keep it slightly modest, the value is very good.\"\n\\\n\"Extremely expensive food ($110++) that has lovely texture but very little flavour. No wow factor from the kitchen. They are good with accommodating allergies.\\\n\\\nService is self-serve family-style sharing which is difficult with a group.\\\n\\\nThis is ultimately a beginner Chinese banquet restaurant for non Asian guests who have never been to luxury Chinese banquet restaurants! We won't be returning.\"\n\\\nDining at Mimi is an experience. The food is DIVINE - service is amazing. They are so attentive and take time to answer all of your questions.

Give it a 2.5 as I feel it was nothing special for the price. There were a few things that were pretty good, like the dessert (steamed cake) and the char siu (very fatty but I enjoyed it). But everything else was very normal. The dumplings/wontons were actually way too salty.\\\n\\\nWould have liked to see more fusion vs straight Chinese food. As is, I can find much better in Chinatown or uptown.\"\n\\\nBy far one of the best meals I\\'92ve had in a long time. The food was super yummy, the servers were super attentive and all of the support staff were friendly and welcoming. I\\'92ll defs be coming back when I can get a reso\n\\\n\"One of the best dining experiences I\\'92ve ever had. The staff is so kind and knowledgeable, the food is coursed out perfectly by the team, the drinks are amazing.\\\n\\\nEvery little detail, from the utensils to the music to the lighting, has been meticulously crafted into an upscale experience. To have this kind of upscale experience for Chinese cuisine [that is NOT fusion] is really remarkable and so necessary.\\\n\\\nThis is my favourite spot in the city, hands down. I\\'92ve now been back 3 more times, and the quality is consistent.\"\n\\\nLiked a couple of the dishes (shrimp toast & char siu) but overall, very overpriced for Chinese food. You\\'92re better off going to a traditional Chinese restaurant. Disappointed in the fried rice and I\\'92m fairly certain I could make a tastier fried rice plus the ginger onion fish was bland and lacked flavour. Nice to try once with friends but will not be returning!\n\\\n\"For a city with the purported diversity that Toronto has, the upper echelons of dining are still mostly populated by Euro-centric restaurants. Within that framework, MIMI stands in stark contrast, in a positive way.\\\n\\\nThat\\'92s not to say that Toronto doesn\\'92t have diversity within fine dining \\'97 only that MIMI is a standout within that.\\\n\\\nIt also doesn\\'92t mean that MIMI can escape the influences of Western dining \\'97 but that\\'92s true even in China, and to expect any exciting and progressive restaurant in the 21st century to fit the confines of any outdated notions of \\'93authenticity\\'94 would be unfair.\\\n\\\nThe menu is indeed small, but also well thought out. The shrimp toast is some of the best I\\'92ve had, where the bread and meat blend in seamless harmony. I\\'92ve had versions of this in Korea, and this iteration blew me away. A must order in my opinion. Another standout is the four foot belt noodle. Both excellent entertainment and tasty.

Big fan!\"\n\\\nWe had a tasting menu pairing with beverages. The waiting staff is pretty knowledgeable and ready to answer our questions. The meal was pretty good.\n\\\nReally nice setting and lovely presentation, but the flavour didn't live up to my expectations. Nothing revolutionary for the price\n\\\nMy favourite restaurant in Toronto so far. The atmosphere was great, classy decor, good service, and friendly staff. We ordered the shrimp toast for appetizer and it was incredible ! We then got the fried chicken and fried rice rolls for our mains, again both meals are top notch!\n\\\nI so wanted to love this restaurant and was so disappointed. The decor is lovely and I would have rated 5 stars on atmosphere if the music were a lower volume. My friends and I could not hear one another at our table, which was a beautiful red velvet booth in the corner. The service is impeccable! My friend got up to go to the restroom and put her napkin down on the booth chair when she got up and within seconds an employee came over and folded her napkin put it on the table and filled her empty tea cup and then slipped away as silently as she arrived. The wait staff are exceptionally well trained and they know how to \"sell\" and \"position\" the food. My partner's father was a chef in Chinese restaurants early in life. Our neice is a pastry chef, and my partner is a gourmet cook. To say we are very familiar with Chinese food would be an understatement. In traditional Chinese food style the food is family style. We started our meal with shrimp toast. It was very good and authentic. Indeed it brought back memories of our youth making shrimp toast at home with my partner's grandmother. So we started out meal with hope. Next came the mapo tofu dish. It came with one bowl of rice to share. Which is understandable because that's how you best serve this dish over white rice. It was underwhelming. Heavy on the salt and seasoning. We ordered the fried rice with salmon roe. It was tasty, and next to the shrimp toast was our favorite dish. Simple to make but good. The four foot belt noodle dish is a gimmick and a RIP off. Over spiced to try and pack in flavour. But a huge miss in every way possible. The crispy Szechuan chicken looked impressive but again was over spiced way too many szechuan pepper corns and peppers. You had to dig through the peppers which they advise you not to eat....no kidding. Well why put so many on the plate? Answer to hide how little chicken there is. The crispy texture on the chicken was nice. But this dish was way too salty as well as over spiced. A real disappointment. The gailan with dry abalone and scallop sauce was beyond disappointing. The minuscule amount of gailan and no flowers only stock and leaves didn't hold up with the sauce. In a typical Chinese restaurant this dish you would find with asparagus. So another miss. The sea bass with ginger and scallions was the third best dish of the meal. The fish was cooked perfectly and was very good quality. Typically hot oil as well as the light soya sauce would be poured on the fish. Here they just used the light soya sauce...so the crispy skin was missing.

Overall our thinking is that the team here have curated a small selection of Chinese food pairing it with a nice atmosphere as a way to introduce the food to an audience who may not otherwise try it in Chinatown. They tried to recreate some very traditional dishes with some hits and misses. Way to heavy on the spices and as a result lost the flavorful subtlety we have grown to love about these dishes. At the price you pay for the meal you really should enjoy it more and not feel ripped off. It so pains me, because we so wanted to love our meal and experience and instead left so disappointed. Oh well, live and learn. If you want an amazing Chinese meal there are plenty of other great restaurants in and around Toronto to experience one from.\n\\\nwe ordered the tasting menu! awesome food!\n\\\nGreat atmosphere and service. All the dishes are good but little cold to us, if they were served when hot would be better. Char siu, and four foot belt noodles are little sweet to us.\n\\\nPerfect date night spot! We chose the Chef\\'92s menu and it was some of the best Chinese we have had in Toronto. Love the cocktails too!\n\\\nTop Notch\n\\\nThis place could be my new favorite restaurant in Toronto. As soon as you walk in the smells of the kitchen waft under your nose. They took our coats and sat at this really comfy booth. The four of us ordered about 14 dishes and that left us completely satiated. It worked out to be about $120 each. Which seemed like a steal considering the attentiveness of the waiters, the speed of the food getting to the table and the creative explanations of all the dishes we ate. I\\'92d say my top three dishes the hidden chicken, the smacked cucumber salad and the 4 foot noodle. Though we egged our server on and she stretched it to like 5 feet. All and all a fantastic night out this place shouldn\\'92t be skipped. Thanks MIMI I\\'92ll be back for sure!!\n\\\n\"This is my first time visit here, it\\'92s a fancy Chinese restaurant. The service was amazing , I like most of the dishes but some of them are not as expected. The washroom was clean. We are party of four and we spend $70/pp here, only ordered one drink.\\\n\\\nHidden spicy chicken was very spicy, I had few bits I can only taste the heat from the chilli, nothing else. The heat was too strong, it took over all other taste.\\\n\\\nStuffed chicken wing was good but really tiny, one serving come with two wings.\\\n\\\nHouse char siu was amazing, very yummy. The use park belly to make it instead of pork shoulder.\\\n\\\nStir fried rice roll was yummy too. I like the burn taste from the rice roll, of course the noodle wasn\\'92t burn or so, I don\\'92t know how they make it but I love it!\\\n\\\nStir fried A Choy was good too, I like how they cook it with oyster sauce and chili shrimp oil. Not too greasy, highly recommend.\\\n\\\nOthers like Yu Xiang eggplant was a bit sour for me. Four foot belt noodle was boring.

The food was nothing special, overhyped and overpriced.\\\n\\\nWe ordered shrimp toast - extremely greasy and the shrimp filling was a little mushier than I like (or used to).\\\n\\\nI had high expectations on the char siu from all the raving reviews, but it was 70% fat and to be honest we brought the leftovers home but never ate it because of how fatty it was. The portion was huge, I\\'92d give them that.\\\n\\\nI wasn\\'92t a huge fan of the sauce for the belt noodles, it was overly sweet.\\\n\\\nThe stuffed chicken wing was the best tasting thing out of our meal!\\\n\\\nOverall, it\\'92s a cute restaurant but nothing special. If you want to score a seat, just give them a call vs reserving online. We called and got same day seats for a late night dinner (9pm).\"\n\\\nAwesome food\n\\\nBest Chinese in the city!\n\\\nfirst of all, a $100 nonrefundable reservation fee?!  Food was decent, but just not enough variety.  Very limited menu and the entrees didn't have much side items to pair. The crispy chicken should be called, 'where is the chicken in the chili peppers'!  Definitely overated.  Too pricey for what you get.  The atmosphere is like a club and we couldn't hear ourselves talk.  Seems to be a trendy, but not got us. * Update* we both woke up with a sore stomach. Yuck!\n\\\nFood was extremely disappointing. Did not understand the prices, considering the lack of flavour in many dishes. Most dishes were also quite traditional, nothing new or innovative in the overall experience. At a table of about 6 of us, and having tried over half the menu, everyone generally preferred the char siu more than anything. Shockingly standard.\n\\\n\"Great service, maybe even too great?our server was lovely but the som was a bit much\\'85\\\nHaving the chef come out and explain every dish to us was a bit disruptive to our conversation.\\\nWas super excited about the 4 foot belt noodle but it was very hard not flavourful and the cook who brought it out immediately cut it into tiny pieces.\\\nThe hidden chicken was disappointing, not a lot of chicken and for that price we were expecting a crispy skin Chinese dish rather than breaded fried chicken, the chilies didn\\'92t add anything to the dish. The Mapo tofu wasn\\'92t very flavourful. The cocktails were fantastic. I loved the cucumber salad. The dumplings were good but nothing special. It was a fun experience but I\\'92d rather go to a Chinese restaurant that focuses on good food. Not enough vegetarian options.\"\n\\\nOverall the chinese food experience is great, we never ordered chinese food with English menu, so a bit challenging for us to guessing whats is the item is.
