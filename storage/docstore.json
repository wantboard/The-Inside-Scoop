Firstly, even for a busy restaurant they have plenty of outdoor seating (patio and rooftop) and would be happy to accommodate you irrespective of a booking or not (but we have been only 2 people though!)\\\n\nThe food is excellent! The salads taste fresh, the appetizers are a good portion (lamb meatballs are super tasty!). The pastas are smaller in portion but have an impeccable taste (truffle paste is a must-try!!!!). Their tiramisu is one of the best I've tried in Toronto, SO SO GOOD!\\\n\\\nLastly, their staff is friendly and service is quick. Would highly recommend it!\"\n\\\n\"This place is great. The atmosphere is amazing. And the ground floor smells so good! We got a pasta, pizza and brussels sprouts app for two people. The brussels sprouts and pasta was 10/10! The pizza was more on the bottom side at 4/10. The crust was just too dry and not enough flavor. Maybe offer a dipping sauce? Their tiramisu was 9/10. It was a great portion. Enough for two people.\\\n\\\nWe came here on a weekday at 5 pm because that is what their website said was available. But even at 7 pm, there were a lot of tables.\\\n\\\nOverall, good experience. We will be back for the pasta for sure!\"\n\\\n\"Amazing Italian restaurant.\\\n\\\nThe atmosphere as soon as you walked in was welcoming and exciting and it seemed like everybody there loved being there. We got seats on the rooftop and it was absolutely lovely.\\\n\\\nMy table shared the eggplant appetizer and I got the mushroom pizza and both were phenomenal. I work at a pizza place so I don\\'92t often enjoy other pizza but something about it this one was so good, I couldn\\'92t resist.\\\n\\\nOur server was okay. He was kind and knew about the menu but not too amicable. It took a while for both the food and the bill to come, which I guess is normal for a Friday night but I still believe it could have been better.\\\n\\\nPerhaps a little pricey but, for the Toronto Fashion District, it\\'92s about expected.\"\n\\\n\"Gusto 101 has a great ambience. It\\'92s high ceilings and it\\'92s industrial loft finishes really give it a cool feel and look.\\\n\\\nGreat service and delicious food.

The food is incredible and the wine is paid by the ounce on Tuesdays which makes it a good place for wine on a budget. The truffle pasta (malfam\\'e9 ai fungi) was amazing. We went as a group of 4 and had focaccia, Brussel sprouts, kale salad and calamari to start with truffle pasta as our mains.\\\nI\\'92m rating 4 stars as they forgot to celebrate our birthday!

The pasta portions are a little small compared to other places but every one we ordered (we got all except the lasagna) was really yummy. The upstairs patio space is nicely laid out too. Be prepared to wait though as they do not take reservations.\n\\\nI have been wanting to try this place since before the pandemic when my co-worker first told me about it. We visit Mississauga every year to visit family, but due to the pandemic, we haven't been in the past two years. The funghi pasta came highly recommended by my co-worker, so I had to try that. My husband and I also ordered the lamb meatballs for an appetizer, daviola pizza, the strip steak and tiramisu. The funghi pasta was AMAZING, and something that I would totally get every time. Everything else was really good too, cooked to perfection. Can't wait to come back again during our next visit.\n\\\n\"Got lasagna and the mushroom pasta here and it was fabulous. The serving of mushroom pasta was very filling and they were generous with the mushrooms too.\\\n\\\nThe service was alright and the food took a very long time to come but they looked busy and perhaps understaffed so that couldn\\'92t be helped.\\\n\\\nOverall, the pasta here made the experience so worth it and I would recommend it highly!\"\n\\\nThe fungi cream pasta was Phenomenal. The steak, even more. You just can't go wrong. Make sure to start off with their Brussels sprouts if you're a fan. The fungi pizza was good but heavy if you're planning on having it among other things.\n\\\n\"Gusto 101 - Celebrating my big 4 0 today and the wifey planned a lovely luncheon. Definitely one of my favourite Italian joints in our great city.\\\n\\\nFor starters we got the carpacccio and their newest salad the invernale (citrus, persimmons, fennel, olives and chilli). Both we absolutely delicious and light enough so we had room for our mains.\\\n\\\nWhenever you visit @gusto101to you must order their malfalde ai funghi and this time we also copped the grilled branzino (I love seafood).

Their pizza is top notch as well. For appetizer I would recommend calamari. For tiramisu, it's decent but not the best one in town, the lady fingers not moist enough and doesn't absorb the coffee/espresso enough.\"\n\\\n\"I\\'92ve been wanting to come to Gusto for the longest time and never got around to it. How have I put it off so long. The atmosphere and space is great for an intimate dinner to catching up with a group of friends. The drinks were on point and the food\\'85 AMAZING rich flavour.\\\n\\\nDon\\'92t be like me and wait for this, just go, run!\"\n\\\nVisited here with friends and had a great experience. We didnt have a reservation but had a seat at the rooftop bistro tables which weren\\'92t really comfortable. The service was fast and nice, the food and drinks came on time and the cocktails were great. The truffle mushroom pasta was reallyyyyyyyy amazing and it was worth the hype. Also the burger was very juicy and flavorful, adding on the calamari was tasty and crispy as well. We will definitely come back again and would definitely recommend this place.\n\\\nGusto is always a good idea. Both locations  Offer beautiful patios with plenty of sunshine. The food is always consistent and service friendly.  Best part about the place is there a dollar ounce house wine and properly traditional Italian eats!\n\\\nGreat atmosphere and dining experience. Super charismatic and attentive staff. We greatly enjoyed the food and sitting at the bar. The Calamarata shrimp pasta was fresh and light; the Salsicce pizza with sausage was really delicious as well. A fluffy tiramisu and rich cannoli were delightful endings to our meal. Compliments to the chef!\n\\\nThe food was quite tasty. Started off with a lamb meatball and tomato sauce with burnt toast. Good taste minus the bread. The star here I would recommend is the pastas. One dish has lots of mushrooms and cream with truffle flavours the other is the bolognese with beef and pork which is meaty. Wish they would ask to add cheese and pepper though.\n\\\n\"A friend of mine recommended this bustling spot - and it wowed me!  The food was top notch, every bite was so flavourful. The beef carpaccio was the best I've ever had.  Every dish was absolutely amazing.   Definitely a new fav spot for comfort food!\\\n\\\nThe tables are packed in quite tight, someone knocked a drink over on my table trying to squeeze in. (He very kindly got us a round-ty!)  The washrooms are communal which isn't my fav, but that's nbd when there are so many other positives.\\\n\\\nMy server was Sydney, she was attentive and personable.

The Diavola pizza, pasta, foccacia, everything was really good and would recommend.

The calamarata was actually my personal favorite! I'm not big on wine, so I paired it with some Birra Moretti - an Italian lager that was light and refreshing.

The pasta could be boiled for some more time as it was crunchy, but the quality of mushrooms and truffle was top-notch!\\\n\\\nService: a little mixed about this. They gave us a table close to the kitchen which made it a little hot. My wife was having back pain so we requested to sit by the sofa but the first 2 servers just declined our request outright in a very rude manner. They were giving excuses that those tables are booked for bigger groups while we saw similar tables with only 2 guests on each table. In addition, this restaurant does not take reservations. A 3rd server approached us and we requested her and showed her the sofa tables with 2 guests. She was kind enough to check with the manager and we finally got a table with sofa. Our server was superb who helped us get a table and we complained to her about the other servers who were rude and did not help with our requests.\\\n\\\nHonestly I want to give this place 5 stars but the initial servers spoiled our mood and experience.

The most authentic Italian restaurant you could have ever visited. The pastas we tried were amazing and very flavourful.

This Italian restaurant has a wonderful ambiance, good music, and very professional staff who pay attention to details. The upstairs dining was closed as it was a Sunday.\\\n\\\nFor starters, we ordered the Carpaccio and Burrata. The Carpaccio was delicious, complimentary flavours that all worked together, especially the mushrooms and parmagiano! The Burrata cheese was very good, however it could have used an extra flavour to complete the dish.\\\n\\\nFor our main, we had the Malfade ai Fungahi and the Lamb Meatballs. The Malfade is Fungahi is to die for and arguably the best dish in the city and the best pasta dish I have personally had! It is a mushroom pasta dish - so creamy and rich with a truffle cream sauce over al dents wide pasta. Would eat this every day!! The Lamb Meatballs were perfectly seasoned and served with a dollop of ricotta. The only suggestion I would have is to add a nice sear on the meatballs to provide some texture. But it was still very good.\\\n\\\nOverall a great experience. We drove over an hour to come here and it did not disappoint. Will come back for sure!

I only wish the meal was larger so there would be more to enjoy.\\\n[Wine] I ordered a bottle of the house wine, it was smooth and I recommend it.\\\n[Atmosphere] I sat inside, but the patio is where you want to be.\"\n\\\nI enjoyed my dinner a lot. The bistec is one of the best I've had in Toronto.\n\\\n\"The food at Gusto is amazing.\\\nThe pizza is fantastic and the calamari is just perfect. I would have just loved if the portion of the calamari was more.\\\n\\\nThe burger is juicy as hell.\"\n\\\nFood was amazing! We were lucky enough to get a reservation thanks to help of some friends!  If walking by on the street, you'd never really give gusto a second look, but once you're inside tasting the food, you understand why there is such a wait for this undercover restaurant. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the washroom situation.\n\\\n\"This is my 8th time visit. Food is great ( as usual). The environment is amazing. But the server was a bit disappointing. He offered me take away box while the main dish just arrived. And while me and my friend were still chatting and enjoying our food, the server came and took my plate and gone (the server never checked on us).\\\n\\\nOverall experience, nice atmosphere and food.\"\n\\\nGood food quality \\uc0\\u55357 \\u56397 , atmosphere\\u55357 \\u56397 , servers are friendly, no parking, a little bit over price in comparison to the portions size, kale salad and mafalde ai Funghi taste great and you can distinguish the balance in taste and how the chef is detail-oriented \\u55357 \\u56397 \n\\\nAmazing Italian food, good vibes and super friendly service.\n\\\nThis is one of the best pastas I\\'92ve ever tried!

I loved the prosciutto and arugula pizza. The lamb meatballs were delicious and paired well with the cavalo nero (kale) salad we got. Great spot for authentic Italian food!\n\\\n\"Went here for bfs birthday. In love with their mushroom pasta and lamb meatballs but they didn\\'92t bring us any dessert or anything even though I made a reservation and said it was my bfs birthday.\\\nIt didn\\'92t matter that much to us but it just would\\'92ve been nice. I really like the vibes here too.\\\nWe also had pepperoni pizza and asked for extra pepperoni. It was great!\"\n\\\nStandard food quality and options. Was unaware of the mandatory 20% tip though not saying that was hidden. The waitress emphasized (three times) that any extra tip would be appreciated. On the basis of a mandatory 20% we won\\'92t return.\n\\\nDinner was excellent. Split a salad, pizza, and main course with a friend. Food was perfectly prepared and relatively fast. Portions were reasonable. Drinks were delicious. Definitely on my list to return next time I'm in Toronto.\n\\\nBeen to gusto a handful of times. Will continue to eat here whenever pasta cravings are present. I\\'92d recommend the mushroom truffle pasta, delicious!\n\\\n\"Dropped by for dinner on a Friday night. We only waited 10 mins before getting at lemon their gorgeous outdoor patio. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and it was apparently a garage for cars before and you can see some signs and decor items to reflect that. I loved it!\\\nThe food was heavenly. So delicious. The portion size for the pasta was a bit smaller than that of the chicken plate. But the taste is superb. The waiter was very helpful and the service was fantastic. We also had olive oil cake at the end and it was very interesting and quite delicious!\\\nHighly recommended place and it\\'92s a nice date night spot!\"\n\\\n\"I never post reviews\\'85 I figured a waste of time but I eat out 3-4 times a week so I think I should start so I warn spenders where to go and not to go\\'85..\\\nGusto 101, Not impressed whatsoever Arrived at 5pm.

The staff were incredibly rude and seemed to have no concern for the customer experience.\\\n\\\nUpon arriving, we were greeted with a cold and indifferent attitude from the host. The atmosphere of the restaurant was uninviting due to the rude staff. I will never be returning to this restaurant again due to the unpleasant experience.\\\n\\\nStaff should be completely retrained in customer service.\"\n\\\nLove the pasta very much. The shrimp is fresh and the sauce is amazing! Hope they provide basil-based source as well. The service is fab!\n\\\nI've previously visited their other sister restaurant (Trettoria Nervosa), and at both location visits, their funghi pasta was impeccable! Perfect texture, and well balanced richness to it! I don't think I will ever get tired of it! The variety of apps that we ordered was also very well made. The patio seating up top is very cute, nice casual space for a casual night out!\n\\\n\"I was charged an extra 7$ to remove cheese from a pizza. They made me custom make a new pizza with less ingredients for 7$ more. I was told the pizza couldn\\'92t be made without cheese as it would ruin the integrity of the pizza yet they made it anyways without mentioning they would charge differently for it? Since when does a pizza have integrity? If anything I should\\'92ve had money deducted from reducing the ingredients for you. I didn\\'92t say anything to my server because he was busy but it truly felt like a tactic to ramp up the bill and his hefty 20% auto grat. He seemed preoccupied and not wanting to be working. Skyler p( never introduced himself, I got this from my bill) Thank-you for the lack of communication and hospitality.\\\nI would not recommend this place to anyone. As a server I know how hard the job could be but how obvious it is when servers are being sneaky. I never want my customers to leave with an experience like the one I had. Unprofessional and underwhelming. Please Do better.\"\n\\\nI\\'92ve been to Gusto 101 more times than I can count have have been a loyal customer for years. The food is always tasty and cooked perfectly. I went tonight with some friends as was very surprised at how small the portion sizes have gotten and was quite disappointed. The mafalde pasta and calamari were extremely small hardly enough for one person let alone for sharing. The sweet potato app was far to expensive for HALF a sweet potato.\n\\\n10/10 experience, the shrimp pasta is to die for!! I saw that gusto is famous for their mushroom truffle pasta.

The food is simple but well executed and delicious, I personally love to stop by for a glass of vino and a pizza before starting the party :) great service too! Cheers\n\\\nDisappointing first experience. Initially, we realized that the online menu we reviewed prior to arrival is obsolete. Upon ordering, we simply requested the egg be hardboiled  (instead of a soft one) for one of the dishes (due to a medical condition), but the waitress couldn't accommodate. So we ended up leaving and enjoyed our brunch somewhere else.\n\\\nWorst experience ever with the manager. My friends started dinner before us. We ended up meeting them afterwards. They charged us 20% tip on the bill (large party) without ever mentioning it or having it written on the physical menu. They told us it was written online but they gave us the paper menu ??? We had an amazing service from the waiter, but when it came to talking with the manager about this issue he kept heavily arguing with us. Never in my life was I disrespected like this by a manager at a restaurant. Not only did he have 0 empathy, but he also had 0 consideration. We tried to end the argument but he kept insisting that not paying the 20% would be rude. We would\\'92ve given a great tip to our server, but being forced to do so with no notice AND being argued so intensely by the manager made us regret going there. If I could give 0 stars to the manager only I would.\n\\\nWasn\\'92t really my first choice. I like space and booth, etc, there is not much room at least in the winter. Wasn\\'92t a fan of Arancini, but maybe I don\\'92t understand it. The Diavola pizza was very nice. Thin, but a good size. Just the right amount of spice. By the end of the pizza I was in a good mood and ordered desserts. Tiramisu was amazing. 5/5. Coffee was very good too. Come for the pizza and the desserts, skip Arancini! Decent price. It was worth it. Good service too.\n\\\nFood  and service was amazing but ambience could be much better.\n\\\nmy boyfriend and I went for dinner at 5pm. we got the kale caesar to share, i had the mushroom pasta, he had lasagna, and we got the tiramisu for dessert. everything was delicious! our server Nick was very attentive, knowledgeable, and had great recommendations. he elevated the night for us and made our experience that much better. we had excellent service and it was a cozy romantic spot for an early valentine\\'92s day dinner.\n\\\n\"Absolutely love love love Gusto 101!

The rooftop patio also has interesting features created from the skylights of the building.\\\n\\\nThe restaurant serves well for most occasions such as birthdays, dates, business dinners or lunches, or just an evening out. Our server was knowledgeable and gave good service with a energetic approach.\\\n\\\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is lively with music and people talking, however, we did not find it too loud at all as we were able to carry on a conversation without trouble. With that said we did lunch there so it might be different in the evenings.\\\n\\\nWhether out for a lunch\\'92s to catch up with old friends or on an evening out to impress, Gusto has you covered!\"\n\\\n\"This place was the biggest let down we\\'92ve had in a while. My wife suggested that we go here based on reviews she read online. I\\'92m certain those reviews are either written by people who don\\'92t know better or publicity.\\\n\\\nThe first thing that was off was the atmosphere and decor of the place.

It\\'92s possible that I misread the reviews online when they said \\'93the atmosphere was welcoming,\\'94 because they could have been written by very young people who welcome the loud dance club yelling to hear each other speak type of vibe.

It was supposed to be a \\'93must try\\'94 on the reviews. It was very salty and the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it had clumped into some kind of gooey salty combination that was not palatable. The pasta tasted bitter for some reason too so I have no idea if that was the intention by the kitchen.\\\n\\\nEntre, pizza margherita, overcooked and dry at the bottom but not bad tasting.\\\n\\\nThe last thing that made our experience unpleasant was the service. The service wasn\\'92t attentive to our needs and they all seemed to be in a rush.

I hate it when servers do that.\\\n\\\nIf you go to this place then expectations should be set accordingly. It\\'92s a fast food place for young people to come and drink plus have a choice of food.

It\\'92s not a family friendly place, and honestly I think Scaddabush is superior to this place if we are to compare a similar restaurant.\"\n\\\nCalamarata pasta was amazing! Burger was definitely too salty \\'85\n\\\nWe visited toronto this weekend and we were extremely disappointed with our experience at Gusto. After waiting 20 minutes for someone to come and see us for drinks in the beginning, we were surprised at the end by an imposed 20% tip fee on our bill because we were 5 people. Absolutely no one mentioned any fixed tips for groups and nothing was mentioned on the physical menu (it was written in the fine prints of the internet menu, but very unlikely to see). We usually give very good tips and don\\'92t mind doing so when having a good service, however not being told from the beginning and having a surprise when receiving the bill is what really bothered us. The manager came to see us and was very rude by saying we were the ones disrespecting him, kept arguing and said they intentionally don\\'92t voice the group fixed tip because its a \\'93bad look\\'94 for the business. I\\'92ve never experienced anything like this from a manager, unbelievable!! We went to another restaurant the next day and the manager was nice enough to warn us right off the bat about the group tip, now that\\'92s appropriate and transparent customer service.\n\\\n\"I was looking for some great Italian places to try out in Toronto and this place caught my attention.

Fries were crispy and then Bruschetta just tasted amazing. In Mains, we tried their famous Truffle Mushroom Pasta and Melanzane Pizza. Both dishes just tasted heavenly. The base of Pizza was very thin and full of cheese. The Pasta was creamy and so yummy. We ended our meal with their Chocolate Cake and Tiramisu. Both of them were really good, especially the Tiramisu one. Overall, a great place to try some amazing Italian food. But it is a little costly. So, it might burn your pockets a little bit.\"\n\\\n\"I swear Toronto has the best rooftop patios/bars and this restaurant is one of them. Gusto 101 is a a beautiful restaurant located in downtown Toronto. My friend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. There wasn\\'92t even a queue to get in, which was a pleasant surprise.\\\n\\\nThe restaurant\\'92s dinning area is split into two levels. We sat upstairs in their gorgeous rooftop area, it kind of reminded me of a greenhouse. The service here was great as well. Our waiter was polite and very attentive.\\\n\\\nI ordered a mimosas ($11 I think) and the eggs in purgatorio which came with a side of grilled sourdough bread with a spicy tomato like sauce on top. The meal was delicious! The flavor was perfect! The eggs do come runny which I normally don\\'92t like but went really well with this meal. I\\'92d definitely recommend trying this place out! There dinner menu looks just as yummy especially if you\\'92re in the mood for Italian.\"\n\\\nThe restaurant is highly recommended. The dishes are relatively in small portion, but good for one person. The mushroom creamy pasta for lunch is really good and not on the menu, but available all the time upon request. The avocado toast is just so so. We also ordered eggs in purgatorio which is good too. The tomato sauce is spicy on top of toasts, with grilled cheese.\n\\\nAmazing food.  Excellent vibe!! The octopus and the tartare are a must.  Service was great.  We loved the mushroom pasta.  The pizza was very good.  I think we'll be getting the same exact order the next time we go here.\n\\\nOne of my favorite restaurants! The mafalde ai funghi is my absolute favorite, a delicious must try for any mushroom/truffle lovers! Also tried the calamari and the arancini, both really tasty as well. The staff are always super friendly and the atmosphere is  lively but intimate.\n\\\n\"Gusto is always an amazing experience! The quality of the food, the taste, and the vibe of the venue is spectacular.

It was crowded and noisy, but full of energy and atmosphere.  The food was great.  The staff were really friendly and attentive.. and the wine on tap was better than I thought it would be.  Would definitely recommend and come back.\n\\\nGreat Italian restaurant. The food was delicious and nicely presented. Service was great as was the ambience. The space is unique and has the options of sitting outside on their patio, the dimly lit intimate first floor and a more open concept for the 2nd floor. I can see why this restaurant is so popular, highly recommend it.\n\\\n\"The food is good and a great environment.

We ordered Tagliata di Manzo, the Omelette. Both of them were delicious. The steak in Tagliata di Manzo was quite tasty was cooked perfect to my liking.

I\\'92m somewhat carnivore and loved this \\uc0\\u55357 \\u56843 . To close the meal, we ordered the Tiramisu, and this was also great. I thought it was sweet but not too sweet, which is perfect. This could\\'92ve been a 5 star experience, but unfortunately we were a little disappointed that it was Brunch menu only on Sunday afternoon. The menu on their site indicated about this under \\'93Brunch Menu\\'94 but not \\'93Lunch & Dinner\\'94. We didn\\'92t realize weekend lunch is brunch only and wasn\\'92t prepared for it. \\u55357 \\u56853 \n\\\nSince moving to Toronto in 2018, Gusto has ranked consistently as one of my favourite restaurants.

I came in to meet friends here for drinks, and the restaurant was less than half full. We asked for a table, and the host literally sneered at us and told us we couldn't have a table unless we ordered food. We agreed to order food, and he sneered at us AGAIN. As a visitor in the city, I was pretty appalled by the attitude of the host. The wait staff was nice and efficient, food was solid. Would not return, though.\n\\\nService was good. They have a brunch menu until 4pm on Sunday\\'92s which we did not realize. There is only one pasta available during this time however the pasta was really good. Fennel sausage pizza was okay. Tiramisu was good but I think the highlight of the meal was the truffle pasta.\n\\\nLovely spot/patio for Italian food! The malfade ai funghi is fantastic! My dish didn't come out hot unfortunately but even then it still tasted so good. I can't wait to go back to try it hot and fresh out of the pan/pot. For mushroom lovers, this is for you. The pasta was thick and cooked perfectly.\n\\\n\"Love this place !!

We asked for rooftop patio seats, waited 1.5hrs and then were given a floor level seat. We ordered 2 pizzas and 1 pasta. One of our pizzas was completely burnt and both had minimal sauce. All dished lacked in flavor, serving sizes are very small and prices are expensive. The food does not justify the price but the location might make up for it.\n\\\nReally nice ambiance. They have a nice patio out in front and in the back. Also serve wine by the ounce which is great. The prices are a little expensive for Italian food and the portions not the biggest. I often order the bucatini pasta which the most recent time I was there was a small portion. Service is good and pizza and kale salad is very tasty. They don't take reservations and there can often be a long wait.\n\\\nDisappointed by the food this go round. Caesar salad was bitter and cacio pepe had too much black pepper which overpowered the flavor.

Food was executed very well, and served fairly quickly considering it was busy. Price points are reasonable for the quality, and service was tentative. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Only complaint is the space can be a little tight, but it was manageable.\n\\\nMafalde is their most popular and tastiest dish! I found the risotto Verde to be too sour. Portion sizes have certainly decreased VS pre-pandemic. Drinks are average and very expensive. Be sure to order their delicious house wine.... Not shown on the menu.\n\\\nThe service did not start off well... my colleague received his drink before the table got our waters? The plates also were dirty and slightly oily. Also when our mains came, they didn\\'92t ask if we wanted anything (i.e. ground pepper, chilli flakes or chilli oil) until we asked and the waiter literally looked confused. Apart from that, overall love the resto, the one waiter that knew what was going on recommended us some options etc - very informative.

Cocktail selection is diverse and the bartenders are inventive when working off the preset drink list. Only 1 beer was offered when I was there, however they have another that was sold out. Food is very very good but not worthy of a perfect 5/5, and we did try almost everything on the preset menu. They do not allow for swapping of accompaniments, which was annoying. It's a great place to go to, and according to people have been before brunch might be more worthy of repeat visits.\n\\\n\"Love the rustic, automotive industry feel decor to the place.

You can book online, or call.\\\nCan't wait to come back in the summer to sit on that patio.\"\n\\\nThis place was fantastic! First time going there, I was there for the dinner time. Busy place but we were seated right away at about 5:30 pm. Food didn\\'92t take a long time at all and tasted amazing! Tried the pizza and the mushroom pasta and loved it. The customer service was awesome as well. I recommend this place and will definitely be back again soon.\n\\\nCan you really say anything besides amazing things about Gusto 101? NO! The food and service never disappoint! They have an amazing wine list, so if you\\'92re on the fence between a glass and splitting a full bottle with someone, go for the bottle! Always worth it here!! \\uc0\\u9829 \\u65039 \\u9829 \\u65039 \n\\\n\"Good atmosphere and good taste of food!\\\nThe octopus was really good and well combination with the three different sauces. I haven\\'92t had a good quality of pasta before. Gusto\\'92s truffle pasta was amazing and delicious. My friend ordered arancini as well, it\\'92s bit salty for me, but still tasty.\\\nServer was so so. The server who was in charge of our table was bit slow and cold, but not bad.\"\n\\\nThe seating felt cramped. The lighting was horrible on the top floor South window wall. It kept going in and out which was very frustrating. The waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. The 44 oz steak and 3 green sides were delicious along with the sour dough bread we dipped in steak juices. Overall, great experience.\n\\\nThe food and service was great however we were a bit disappointed as the menu on their site (lunch and dinner) was not offered at the time we went (1pm).

It was just yogurt, seeds, a few grapes, and some nuts. I feel like I should have tried something else on the menu, since there are better options.\"\n\\\nThe food is just great. My wife and I had the escarole salad, pizza with mortadella and pistachio, lentils and handmade bread. Everything was super delicious. They also have a good selection of wines. The staff is very nice and friendly. We sat at the bar and it was really a great experience. We also found out that Gusto101 is is the same family of Trattoria Nervosa. Another amazing place to try in Yorkville. These are must-try place.\n\\\nCasual place for delicious Italian! It\\'92s on the pricier side but the food is delicious. Portions are slightly on the smaller side. Highly recommend their funghi pasta, the kale salad, and their pizzas!\n\\\nVery nice restaurant, when weather approves try and go on the terrace on the second floor, it is well worth it for the atmosphere. The brunch menu is fantastic, can't go wrong with any choices. The waiter was also very accommodating.\n\\\nI've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit because you cannot go wrong with $1 oz house wines! Pizzas, pastas, salads are all consistently delicious here. Eat the pizzas while they're hot because the slices do not hold up!\n\\\nI absolutely loved this place. Found a seat on the amazing patio. The staff was super friendly and made every effort to get the order right. The pizza was one of the best ones I have ever had. It was a well done authentic pizza! The Cannoli ordered as a dessert was crunchy and had an amazing flavour. Over all the experience was worth it and i would definitely recommend this place!\n\\\n\"This was my second time at Gusto 101 while visiting Toronto - reserved ahead of time.\\\nStaff was friendly and helpful.\\\nI brought my 9 month old boy and didn\\'92t expect them to have seating for him so I was prepared to have him on my lap throughout dinner.

Great atmosphere!\n\\\nReally really good service. Everything was amazing from start to finish. Had scallops, mushroom pasta and steak. Except I'm not describing as eloquently.  Perfectly paired with a red. So damn good. Amazing setting. Great bathrooms even.\n\\\nI love this place almost as much as I love its sister restaurant - Yorkville's Nervosa. As with Nervosa, the food here is consistently delicious and I very much enjoy the Gavi by the glass. Try the mafalde al fungi or the Rigatoni Bolognese. Both excellent pastas!\n\\\nFood was great but our server wasn't too friendly.

This makes no sense because they don\\'92t take any reservations and the same middle section they say is available for us had the same amount of seating where a group of 4 could\\'92ve sat. Both booth and other tables could seat a group of 4 but they didn\\'92t let us sit at the booth.\\\n\\\nWe were offered to sit up stairs at first but it was far too busy and loud for a date like dinner so we opted for a middle seat on the ground floor right by the kitchen. Throughout our night no one sat at the booth which we had originally requested (even though they said someone called but on their website and phone they at no reservations and only accept walk ins). Whatever, our waiter wasn\\'92t the most personable or relatable, did what he had to do but didn\\'92t make any extra effort to make our night special. Didn\\'92t have a conversation. Anti social.\\\n\\\nOur Mafalde Al Funghi was just alright, it had been much more tastier before, something was missing. Seemed the pasta was hard not soft. I asked the waiter if he could do some special surprise for my GF he suggested cannoli or tiramisu, I said cannoli. I had a feeling this wouldn\\'92t be free so I was okay with it but I didn\\'92t think it would be $12, that\\'92s fine but a warning would be nice. This is more of a heads up.\\\n\\\nOverall, I think we will give gusto another chance perhaps in the summer but for now it left a kind of bad impression where we will look for other restaurants for our pasta cravings.\"\n\\\nGood service. The grilled octopus was so yummy! The olive sauce that came with it was my favorite. This is the first place I was served Peroni beer in a tall beer glass, which I very much appreciated. Also, the pappardelle was delicious.\n\\\n\"Its been my 4th visit to Gusto and it's always been amazing.\\\n\\\nOur server Josh has served me for the third time and he has always been excellent!!!!!\\\nLoved the new cocktails that Josh suggested.\\\n\\\nWe also tried out a few new dishes this time and they were all amazing.

Great first bite - got a bit heavier after each successive bite. The Asissi cocktail was citrusy, light, and refreshing, counterpointed with the bite of lavendar from the sprigs. Will be back to try the famous kale salad and other dishes. Great service, cool decor and ambiance.\n\\\n\"We traveled into Toronto for the weekend from NY and were seeking a modern Italian cuisine. Gusto 101 exceeded our expectations for a number of reasons. The wait was approximately 45min which gave us plenty of time to explore the surrounding neighborhood which we enjoyed. We were quickly seated after arriving back. Once ordered, dinner arrived sooner than expected and was phenomenal both in taste and presentation. Further, our server Benjamin was incredible. He not only offered helpful insight for our weekend vacation stay but went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful experience. On the way out, we accidentally left our helpful map our hotel provided but Benjamin ran out and chased us halfway down the street to return it!\\\n\\\nWe highly recommend and will be sure to return upon our next visit!\"\n\\\nSuch great vibes and delicious Italian food.

Great service, Pinterest-worthy interior, and a well rounded menu with delicious, modern Italian options. The mushroom pasta is absolutely UNREAL. Hot tip (literally): ask your server for some of the house made chilli oil to go with their fresh focaccia. So good!!!\n\\\nThe truffle mushroom pasta and the kale salad are to die for. My all time favourite restaurant. I can't stand downtown but I will travel downtown for a meal from here!\n\\\nGlad to see that they required masks worn when traveling through the restaurant. Our server was amazing and gave us very clear recommendations which were amazing! We had the diavlo pizza and the mushroom pasta. The mushroom pasta was great with some added chilli oil. Also had a raspberry margarita which was good but oddly had alot of added spice.\n\\\n\"Came here with friends for Brunch, its a nice restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating in the summer.\\\nOnly giving this place 3 stars because im generally not a fan of Brunch food. I had the Uova in Camicia which was ok. I liked the poached eggs with hollandaise sauce, the potatoes were nice and crispy and there was a side of kale.\"\n\\\nDelicious! This place was recommended to me from a local. We had 7 people in our group with varying dietary restrictions. Everyone was extremely satisfied with the service, food, and atmosphere. I\\'92d go back in a heartbeat!\n\\\nThey made me a beautiful vegan pizza and it was delicious!! Love the beautiful upstairs deck with sky light, which gives the feeling of eating outside without pesky insects and wind blowing your hair into your lip gloss. The drinks menu and no reservations policy make it the perfect last minute choice for a chic dinner. One of my go-tos, along with sister restaurant Nervosa in Yorkville.\n\\\nGusto is a great restaurant. The food is always good and you can try different dishes without being worried.\n\\\nThis is my fave go-to place with my girls! We dine here at least 2-3 times a month!

I also highly recommended the fungi pasta,the sauce was amazing\n\\\nI really liked the food here! Had the mafaldi al funghi pasta, margherita pizza and the burger, and all three dishes were amazing. The pasta was so creamy, pizza was the perfect crispy texture with amazing sauce and the burger was cooked perfectly - I like that you can order it medium instead of well done. They have two stories so it wasn\\'92t a problem for us to get a table on a Friday night even though we didn\\'92t have a reservation.\n\\\nHad Gusto 101 for the first time last night. Everything was excellent. Arancini & the bolognese were my two favourites, they were so so so good. Best pasta I\\'92ve ever had. Cannoli was also excellent. Also had salad, pizza, and fresh burrata, all very good. I\\'92ve read some reviews about poor service, but this was not the case for us. The staff waiting on us were all friendly, and attentive. I accidentally had red wine dripped onto my pants and the server came right over with club soda, I didn\\'92t even have to ask, and it worked! The stain was gone. Above and beyond service. Prices are fairly high, but are justified. You are getting a high quality, fresh product, in a lovely ambiance, well worth the price. Highly recommend.\n\\\nAllergy-ist if that is even a thing.  Refused to serve the table any food because one person has a peanut allergy.  Nothing on the menu contains peanuts\\'85 waitress was extremely condescending.\n\\\nWow wow wow.  Look no further. We spent an hour trying to figure out what to eat and at last this came as a suggestion. Amazing!  We tried four dishes: pizza, salad, past and tiramisu.

We also split the PIZZA FUNGHI (yummy!!) : shiitake, oyster mushroom, fior di latte, taleggio, pecorino, and caramelized onions. A great gem on Portland!\n\\\nThe service here is on point. The restaurant was starting to get crowded but we had staff coming to check in on us in a timely manner. I was pretty impressed considering how many people there were and there was also a large group there for an birthday or something, so you know they're doing well.

The grilled octopus was my main attraction to here, and handmade pizza also. So that&#39;s been requested. And we both agreed this a great choice. Portions were large enough to satisfy, but not feel stuffed. The Grilled Octopus was wonderful as stated in other reviews. The Margarita Pizza initially looked barren, but was flavorful and the best handmade crust. I&#39;m coming in again.\n\\\nThe food is to die for...delicious! \\'a0The resto has rustic hardware decor and a chill ambiance. \\'a0Our server was awesome and the staff all seemed happy...smiling and dancing. \\'a0Great vibe!\n\\\nI&#39;m lactose intolerant and there wasn&#39;t a whole lot on menu that I could order. Portions r pretty small for the price. I like the $1/ounce wine that&#39;s available all day\n\\\nThe ambiance here is the standout for me. Downstairs is cozy and dark (great date spot) while upstairs feels like a greenhouse -- full of natural light with tons of windows. Chairs were hard and uncomfortable and the noise level made conversation difficult, but the views made up for it. There aren&#39;t many kid-friendly restaurant options in the city, and this isn&#39;t an exception. We paid full price for buttered noodles and a pepperoni pizza with no cheese (our son is lactose intolerant), but the food was scrumptious. I ordered the lasagna -- some of the best and least greasy I&#39;ve had -- while my husband got the branzino. He said it might be the best he&#39;s ever had. Service was friendly and crazy fast considering how busy they were.\n\\\nservice was horrible. server had brown stuff on her hand when she was holding my food. smelt kinda bad..\n\\\nGood food, good vibes, great company<br><br>Food: Had the mushroom truffle pasta (a must-order if you&#39;ve never been) which was creamy and heavy, despite what at first glance appeared to be a small portion size. It was rich and decadent without being too filling, and was great for dinner or to share. For appetizers, our group got the calamari (nothing too special, typical calamari you would expect at any Italian restaurant) and the house bread with burrata and figs, which is recommended as well. The balance of hint of sweetness of the fig and creaminess of the burrata cheese balances each other out, and it very complimentary with the bread.<br><br>Service: The staff was very friendly and there when you need them, and served our orders fairly quickly. <br><br>Atmosphere: The place was spacious enough for groups of all sizes, with the upstairs being more casual (but also intimate as it was very dimly lit with candles on the tables), and the lower level being more romantic (for dates).\n\\\nPros: \\'a0Great ambiance and cool interior.

Not sure why the kitchen thought that was acceptable. <br><br>Overview: \\'a0Generally the food was ok. But the pizza being so poorly topped left a bad taste in our mouth. For the price I would have expected better.\n\\\nI got the Cacio e pepe and chicken on the side. Not going to lie, I didn&#39;t like the pasta at all unfortunately. I&#39;m super easy when it comes to pasta but it seemed like it wasn&#39;t boiled enough at all. The sauce was good so I dipped the chicken into that. The salads were amazing though, specifically the cavolo nero. Service was excellent!\n\\\nI loved this place, amazing food and service! The pastas are great as well as pizza, have yet to find a dish done wrong. Very unique interior as well.\n\\\nSo if you haven&#39;t heard already, the truffle pasta is their specialty! Honestly don&#39;t waste too much time with the menu if it&#39;s your first time. Do yourself a favor and get the pasta and maybe an appetizer or side. I didn&#39;t think the pasta was filling alone but then again I did go to the restaurant when I was pregnant. We got a plate of calamari to share among 4. It was okay. Nothing out of this world. People at our table ordered other main dishes and were happy with their meal! The tiramisu was delicious, highly recommended from the desserts menu! Service was okay - nothing to comment on that. Check it out, and enjoy!!!\n\\\nThe food was really good, and it was very easy to get a table with lots of seating available. The time that they have for lunch in terms of your seating time is an hour and 45 minutes, so if you are having a birthday party or would like to sit a little bit longer it is something to consider.<br><br>That mood is very nice and feels like an interesting spot. It is not the easiest location to get to you. If you want some thing that is easily accessible by transit. You would need to take the street car from the main TTC station. <br><br>The food was quite excellent. The Caesar salad was one of the best ones that I have had and you could tell that the kale has had time to absorb the dressing. The spaghetti Bolognese had a significant amount of meat, and it was delicious. The octopus was very good as an appetizer, that was a little bit on the price yet and given the portion size. <br><br>There was a wide variety of cocktails and drinks all of which are tasty. If you enjoy our martini, there are a lot of different martini options. <br><br>The only thing that made this restaurant a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 what is the service that left a little bit to be desired. \\'a0It was definitely very average. The servers did not ask if you wanted any pepper or cheese with your pasta. If you order a beer, do not expect it to be poured for you.

Cannoli are 100/10, taste sweet with a bit of tang and a nice crunch, very nice candied peel with them as well, brussels sprouts are delish, they&#39;re the good sort of juicy blackened with a nice caramel-y tinge, had the cacio e pepe and it was great, the noodles were a bit thick but that&#39;s not a quality issue just a matter of personal taste, the person I was with said that the creaminess and the pepper blended just right\n\\\nOnce trusted and reliable Gusto 101 manages to underwhelm with every incremental visit.

There&#39;s a lot of hype and I can see why; this place just hits different for the both of us. You need to see the descriptions of the items we got to share below for more mind-blowing details. <br><br>- Mafalde Al Funghi [GET]: OMG, insanely al dente pasta with an unbelievable sauce. The sauce was so truffle-y, rich, and smooth. It was so delicious, and probably one of the creamiest and silkiest pasta cream sauce I&#39;ve had besides at other high-end restaurants. It is PERFECTLY cooked with an amazing texture, and definitely beautifully executed. Each bite was heavenly and irresistible. I love the huge chucks of portobello, porcini oyster mushrooms and parmesan cheese on top, they didn&#39;t skimp out on the ingredients. It also added an additional layer of texture for sure! Beware though, it can get heavy towards the end, but my boyfriend didn&#39;t mind it. <br><br>- Pepperoni [GET]: Whoa! Pizza exceeded my expectations. The pizza is thin crust with a chewy dough and crust, very similar texture to the ones I&#39;ve had in Europe. You need to eat fast before it gets soggy, otherwise you can use a knife and a fork, HAHA. I love the pomodoro tomato sauce. It&#39;s acidic and tangy, pairs wonderfully with the fresh mozzarella cheese. The pepperoni tastes homemade, fresh, and meaty. The buckwheat honey and funnel oil drizzled on top was chef&#39;s kiss. If you haven&#39;t try honey on pizza, definitely as soon as possible. <br><br>- Focaccia Bread [GET]: Gusto&#39;s freshly made focaccia bread. First, they are thick, but super light, fluffy, and pillow-y. I just wished it was toasted a bit more though. It is also greasy, but in a very good way. I see them drizzle a good amount of olive oil before they serve it, and that olive oil elevates the bread so much. I don&#39;t know what it is, but the olive oil added an interesting umami flavor to it, and it was delicious. The rosemary works so harmoniously and balances so well with the bread. You have to get this too!<br><br>Ambiance: 4.75/5 - The vibe is awesome, and the perfect spot for date nights.

Our staff was friendly and prompt, greeted us immediately and constantly filling out our water glasses throughout the night. He provided some nice recommendations on pizza and was kind enough to take a picture for my boyfriend and me as well. <br><br>BLUF: Italian food has been the quintessential go to restaurants for me, especially when I get to pick our date night spots. Gusto serves some of the best truffle pasta and delicious pizza in GTA at some very reasonable prices. I highly recommend the truffle pasta, indeed the MUST get item here, and maybe add the focaccia bread too so you can use it to finish up the leftover creamy truffle sauce. Lastly, I would 100% come back anytime!\n\\\nWe came here on a Saturday late afternoon with a reservation and was seated right away. It was my first time coming after hearing about all the hype, but it was not what I expected.<br>For whatever reason, the food came out weirdly quickly, which makes me think it was not freshly cooked. We ordered one pasta and one lasagna and they were both just warm, and very quickly turned cold.<br><br>Overall, my experience was not the best, for the price I wish they would pay more attention to the details like making the food at least hot.\n\\\nThe service was very attentive. The server asked if we have any allergies and was good at accommodating them. The ambiance was nice, but the tables were too close together. I felt like I was eating with strangers. The food was disappointing. We ordered the calamari which was undercooked and the flavour felt a little lazy, not fresh for the price of $20! The pizza was burnt on the sides and the flavour was not particularly amazing for the price. The only thing I thought they nailed was the salad which I mean was good but not the reason we went there. I was excited to go, but won&#39;t be back again .. there are plenty of amazing Italian spots in Toronto and this was not one for me.\n\\\nWe dropped by for a casual weekend dinner on the rooftop (enclosed) patio last month, and were seated promptly despite being early for our reservation.<br><br>Given that Gusto 101 is a Toronto institution, we were excited to try the pasta bolognese and lasagna - two of our favourites.

They&#39;re known for their truffle pasta which I get every time and kale salad. Everything on the menu is delicious. Highly reccommended.\n\\\nWe went here for dinner, and it was sooo good. The ambiance is really nice and service was pretty quick too. Talking about the food, was very impressed and definitely something I&#39;d come back for. The bread was really good and moist. Meatballs was pretty good and the sauce complimented it really well. Overall, would 100% come back.\n\\\nThere was a lot of hype around gusto 101 and I think it fell flat on the expectations. We started with the pepperoni pizza, kale salad and calamari. The pepperoni pizza was good, especially with the hint of honey. The kale salad was honestly mediocre, but the dressing was relatively tasty. The calamari pieces were small, lacked breading and wasn&#39;t super crispy. <br><br>I was excited to try the famous mushroom pasta. The sauce was extremely heavy and the truffle flavour was overpowering. However, the pasta itself was cooked perfect al dente. <br><br>The ambiance is nice, but it did feel really loud inside. <br><br>Overall, I was left wishing for more from this experience. But I&#39;d still say it&#39;s worth a try.\n\\\nImpressive venue and good service but food lacked the &#34;Gusto&#34; I was looking for. There&#39;s two floors across this massive space. The second floor rooftop patio has a car theme to it. Tucked away off King Street.\n\\\nCame in here for the mafalde ai funghi which did not disappoint! We also got the diavola pizza 3.8/5 nothing too special. The tiramisu was good and enough to share w/ 2-3 pax. Overall, would be back for the pasta! And cocktails\n\\\nTheir Mafalde Al Funghi is super popular, I love the mix of oyster mushrooms and truffle cream sauce with the pasta. We also tried out the Diavola which was super yummy, I loved the salami and roasted peppers.\n\\\nFrom start to finish, Gusto 101 was a disappointing dining experience.

My friends and I arrived around 8 PM and were seated right away - this is the first time that&#39;s happened to me, so we started the night in great moods! We knew what we wanted because we&#39;ve been here (and 501) several times, so we placed our orders. Appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time, but one friend got his main with his appetizer for some reason. That was OK, he was hungry . Then some time passes, then some more, and some more.. We see orders that look like ours passing by every minute, but none of them are for us. The waitress comes by and asks us if we got our food to which we answer, no. She comes back a while later and tells us the system is glitchy and that it should be coming any moment. AN HOUR AND A HALF passes and we still don&#39;t have our food. My pregnant friend asks our waitress if she&#39;s going to do anything about it, to which she answers, she&#39;ll talk to the managers. She did nothing. Our waitress would come by every now and then to check if we got our food, to which we answered no. We finally received our meals after my girlfriend went to someone (who wasn&#39;t serving us) and asked if our meals were ever coming, and he somehow brought our meals over. I wish our waitress had owned up to the fact that she didn&#39;t put our order in the system instead of blaming the system itself. There was barely anyone left in the restaurant by the time we were leaving... The waitress said they would comp the appetizers, but then proceeded to hand us bills with the appetizers still on it.

She asked us how we wanted to split the bread, to which we answered, we thought you were comping it... Paying the bill was very confusing, I think our waitress was a bit new. I genuinely felt bad for her, but it was just very bad service. Maybe she needed more training. To be honest, I think what made the experience worse was our waitress saying things like, &#34;if this was my restaurant your meal would be comped&#34;, then leave and come back to say &#34;... is it good? is the food good?&#34;. It&#39;s like she wanted us to think they&#39;d comp our meal but nah, headfake.<br><br>I don&#39;t get to see my friends often so it&#39;s too bad when something like this happens. The food itself was good but man... our moods were killed. I used to recommend this place to out of towners, coworkers, and friends... but I won&#39;t be going forward based on how this was handled. Another thing I want to mention is that Uber pickups were annoying as we were seated next to the deliveries door. So they&#39;d come quite frequently with their flashing bike lights to grab orders from the middle of the restaurant. \\'a0It took away from our experience.\n\\\nMust try spot in Toronto!! This is a pretty classic Italian restaurant with great food - they are known for the mushroom pasta which definitely lived up to the hype.

If you&#39;ve never been, it&#39;s a must try!\n\\\nI usually love coming here for the ambiance and the mushroom pasta, but today I wasn&#39;t so impressed. My boyfriend arrived and ordered a margarita (the drink). The waitress somehow mistook that for a margherita pizza, but ended up bringing us a pizza that wasn&#39;t a margherita anyways. We didn&#39;t order the pizza and couldn&#39;t eat it as there was meat on it. After telling the waitress we did not order this, she acted really confused and was arguing saying that we did (why would we order something we can&#39;t eat??) and kept asking if we wanted plates for the pizza. Finally she realized she made a mistake, but didn&#39;t offer to take it off the bill or comp us for it so we were stuck with this pizza we didn&#39;t eat.<br><br>We were then left alone for 15 mins without food until I \\'a0flagged her down to finally ask her to take our order for the food we actually wanted, which was the mushroom pasta.

The kitchen will not accommodate requests. I wanted a pasta change to spaghetti (which they have), and it wasn&#39;t an allergy matter. Nonetheless, George Brown cooks don&#39;t know how to cook when not prepared in a bag for them to heat up. I&#39;d recommend Gusto if you want a roof top patio experience and a place where you don&#39;t need to use an inside voice. Food wise, it&#39;s just ok.

They must have 40 seats there and only one couple was sitting around 2:15pm. A rude server (called Rami according to the hostess) spoke to us like we were stray dogs &#34;don&#39;t sit there&#34; when we tried to move table to one of 20 empty tables near ours because the sun was hitting hard and we had no protection. He then forced us back to the initial table and said he would adjust the sunshade so we wouldn&#39;t burn. He moved it by an inch and I told him I&#39;ll check if we are actually covered. He saw I still had the sun hitting me hard and just left. I called him as he was steps away and going nowhere important (the place was empty and with nothing to do) and he ignored my call 3 times (he was two tables away) and refused to adjust the shade.

At Cibo they know how to treat you properly like human beings and bonus: the food wasn&#39;t cold and no attitude was provided.\n\\\nStopped by because a friend was craving Italian food. Ordered a pizza, focaccia, and eggplant to share, plus the mushroom pasta. <br><br>The pizza was a bit underwhelming, but everything else was exceptional. Also love \\'a0that Gusto sells their house wines a dollar per ounce, so you don&#39;t have to break the bank getting a drink with your meal. <br><br>Would recommend it for the pasta, eggplant app and dollar/ounce wine, but not sure I would get pizza again. <br><br>FYI like most Toronto establishments, washrooms are in the basement via stairs only and are therefore not accessible.\n\\\nI was told about this restaurant recently by my friend who lives in Toronto. Also I&#39;ve seen this place all over Instagram. The restaurant is super cute and I love the way it was set up. They have an outdoor patio, indoor seating and a rooftop patio as well. We wanted to be seated on the rooftop but it was closed off for an event. So we were seated indoor. <br><br>Since it was my first time here, the waitress was really helpful in telling us the popular dishes on the menu. (Cause I didn&#39;t research the restaurant prior to going, lol). We ordered the burrata with house-made bread to start which did not disappoint. The bread was made fresh and tasted perfect with the burrata. We also ordered the cavolo nero salad which was absolutely amazing. The dressing in the salad went perfectly. For our meal we ordered the mafalde ai funghi pasta which was soo good. It was the vegetarian option on the menu. And looking around so many people had ordered this dish. <br><br>The atmosphere and vibe here was really nice. Definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu!\n\\\nmy friend and i loved it here!!! the vibes are impeccable and the dinner was scrumptious our waiter, kaleb suggested two desserts for us to try that farrr surpassed our expectations. i cannot recommend enough.\n\\\nAmazing food. We got grilled eggplant starter, shrimp pasta and prosciutto pizza, they are all awesome. My favorite was the pizza, it was fresh and not heavy. Service was also friendly. Enjoyable experience, would come back again!\n\\\nBeen in Toronto for 4 decades and visited many Italian restaurants. Nothing beats their cavolo Nero and Mafalde al funghi. Fast paced environment, buzzing spot.\n\\\nLocals recommend this place .. so you know it&#39;s got to be good !<br>We sat at the bar .. the bartender knew what he was doing excellent drinks . <br>our meal was fantastic .. especially the pasta . Will definitely go back !\n\\\nOne of the best restaurants I&#39;ve been to! The food was great, I really enjoyed the mafalde al funghi, however, it is really heavy so I recommend sharing it if you&#39;re not a fan of heavy sauce (also eat it quickly before it gets cold).

We visit Mississauga every year to visit family, but due to the pandemic, we haven&#39;t been in the past two years. The funghi pasta came highly recommended by my co-worker, so I had to try that. My husband and I also ordered the lamb meatballs for an appetizer, daviola pizza, the strip steak and tiramisu. The funghi pasta was AMAZING, and something that I would totally get every time. Everything else was really good too, cooked to perfection. Can&#39;t wait to come back again during our next visit.\n\\\nVisited recently on a nice day and sat on the upstairs patio. We got the iconic kale salad, Arancini, branzino and two orders of the risotto verde. Great service, great food all around! Thanks Gusto!\n\\\nI finally tried this place after all the good things I&#39;ve heard! <br><br>This place is fairly busy...thank goodness for the rooftop level we were able to secure a spot. The service was excellent and the vibes were immaculate. It&#39;s a good place to catch up with friends and even for dates. <br><br>We started with the brussel sprouts which is my personal favourite out of the three things I&#39;ve ordered. It looks very burnt but it doesn&#39;t taste like that at all. It was very refreshing and light. I personally wouldn&#39;t share this again just because I love it that much LOL! <br><br>The mushroom pasta is what I really came for. It was very creamy and rich. It ended up being very heavy towards the end. I found the truffle oil to be too much towards the end. In person the portion is quite small for the size but because of the heaviness I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way. <br><br>Lastly the pasta wasn&#39;t bad either. It is a very thin crust with meat , spinach , cheese and some red pepper paste as well. The paste definitely helped to cancel out any of the oiliness. <br><br>I would definitely come back again!\n\\\nWent out with some friends for dinner! The ambience is quite nice but also very busy with lots of waiters/staff weaving their way in-between all the tables.<br><br>The drinks were strong, tasty, and well presented. The calamari was flavorful and had a perfect squid to breading ratio. The pizza is the star of the show! Extremely delicious with an amazing crust! However, the two pastas we ordered were pretty disappointing. The Funghi pasta was too salty and the Bolognese tasted quite plain.

I love the ambiance here - perfect for a date night or a nice spot to catch up with friends over good food!\n\\\nHad<br>- mafalde al fungi : I love all of that rich mushroom/truffle sauce. The creamy sauce and the rich flavor match perfectly the wide thick pasta. The pasta was cooked al dente perfectly.<br><br>- calamari: Super tender and with the right amount of seasoning. It came with fresh Aioli sauce:)<br><br>- \\'a0beef tartar: super thin and tender, \\'a0garnished with fresh aioli - melt on the tongue.\n\\\nBEST PASTA! The food was so delicious. The pizza and calamari was also incredible. Definitely a spot to try out in Toronto\n\\\nMy friend had visited this restaurant 4 years ago during her undergrad. For her birthday we wanted to surprise her with a dinner here. <br><br>The staff were really nice and accommodating as they let us sit for 30 minutes before ordering as we were waiting for my friend and were getting settled when she arrived. <br><br>We got a mix of pizzas and pastas, all of which tasted so good. My mushroom pasta was delicious, and I tried the pizzas which had really yummy sauce. That to me is the most important part of a pizza and the restaurant really aced it. <br><br>The one complaint I have though is that when we had asked to split my friend&#39;s bill for her birthday, the waiter made a mistake and split her order by 7 instead of 6 people. Instead of re printing the receipts he just added the extra order onto another friends bill. Although it wasn&#39;t much of a price difference, this was not very courteous, especially because the friend didn&#39;t feel comfortable asking the waiter to reprint. That&#39;s just something that should be done without having to asking a restaurant goer if they want to reprint, because it can be uncomfortable to speak up<br><br>Other than that, we had a pleasant experience!\n\\\nI went here and loved the mafalde al fungi a few years ago so re ordered it for delivery, and honestly this is my favourite dish on the menu (I&#39;ve had some of the meat dishes and kale salads) I will come here for this mushroom pasta dish! <br><br>Even with delivery the other night and it was perfectly made, al dente, right temperature. <br><br>The kale salad on the other hand was very underwhelming. The kale was in large pieces hard to eat, and a few pieces of bacon and cheese for $17???? Not worth it. For that price I wish more care had been taken to make the kale pieces edible as I assume that&#39;s what the high price is for.\n\\\nI haven&#39;t been to this King West staple in forever and wish I had given it another try sooner!<br><br>We", "doc_id": "6db7e006-9799-483c-b51a-9d3eacb73a0c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "36c175580e612792e03e2b2ac75bac74ae2e9bd58461b0912903aa35256b78cf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 45445, "end": 48940}, "relationships": {"1": "e38a0afd-f85c-4e7b-abca-e23e665cfa7e", "2": "1805f82b-ffd3-49f6-b17e-3870c00ef9ff", "3": "42a1c72f-c43e-488c-82cd-4f778c2b1dc5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "42a1c72f-c43e-488c-82cd-4f778c2b1dc5": {"__data__": {"text": "and honestly this is my favourite dish on the menu (I&#39;ve had some of the meat dishes and kale salads) I will come here for this mushroom pasta dish! <br><br>Even with delivery the other night and it was perfectly made, al dente, right temperature. <br><br>The kale salad on the other hand was very underwhelming.

Everything was always fresh and delicious, and you can tell that the pasta is made in-house, because the pasta was always a delectable al dente. However, the dish I absolutely adore is the Mafalde Al Funghi. It&#39;s a pasta with portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce. This i definitely THE dish to get. During the summer there was also a peach mozarella dish that was also super refreshing and still makes my mouth tingle thinking about it Love how they have some seasonal items to try out.<br><br>Though it&#39;s very obvious that the Gusto 101 ethos and style is very different, I would put Gusto 101 at a similar level to Scaddabush, if not for the funghi pasta, which is why I&#39;ve deducted half a star from 5 for flavour.<br><br>Although I am no wine person, it&#39;s worth noting that my friends also enjoyed the wine selection available here to pair with your meal :) <br><br>Place (3.5/5) :<br><br>The restaurant itself is beautiful, but if only it was brighter for me to admire it!

I get it, fancy restaurants are usually dim lit, but this restaurant was particularly dark. They gave us an ambient candle to light up the table, but it was still quite dark. So dark, in fact, that our server kept missing us when we tried to order more or ask for water. Service was great when they could see you! Also notable that if you&#39;re going to dine-in, it is an expensive area to park in, if you can find parking on the weekend. <br><br>Otherwise, this is a great place for dates and friends to hang out for great pasta and a few drinks as well! <br><br>Follow my insta @joelyho for more foodie stuffs!\n\\\nMust Try: Mafalde Ai Funghi, Margherita Pizza <br><br>Rating: (10/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness <br><br>Experience: One of our favourite Italian restaurants, as their dishes are elevated above what we&#39;ve ever expected. I personally love their mushroom pasta, as we come exclusively for that alone some times (it also travels well so the take-out version is great). Other great dishes include the Kale salad (basic but boogie) and beef tartare. They also have in-house wine (red and white) that you can pour by the oz, which lets you either go easy for the night or a hard as you want. <br><br>An elevated classic Italian restaurant is what I would call Gusto. I would highly recommend!\n\\\nDidn&#39;t know i could&#39;ve made reservations for NYE but was really lucky i got to end the year here!\n\\\nI had been wanting to come here to celebrate special occasions since 2014 but somehow just missed the opportunity and every time ended up dining at chain restaurants. Fast forward to 2021 while visiting Downtown Toronto, I finally went to Gusto 101 for a date night with my husband. It was not very crowded on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately, as socially distanced as possible from other tables. The inside of the restaurant has a nice, romantic and rustic charm with tea lights at each table - nice for a date night but not spaced out if you&#39;re looking for privacy. The tables are quite close and you could easily hear the conversations at the next table. But that&#39;s the case with many restaurants downtown that have an intimate setting. We did not get to see their rooftop patio since it was closed for winter. For appetizers we shared an order of the arancini which was good but on the sweet side due to the saffron risotto in it. For mains I ordered their popular mushroom pasta, it was really delicious and worth the hype. My husband got the Margherita pizza - the crust was thin and quite soggy towards the middle of the pizza almost like a wrap! I really liked the sauce on the pizza though. For dessert we got the tiramisu. Every dish had extremely small portion sizes. Also our waiter took very long to come to our table to take orders for food, drinks and also to bring the bill. We were not in a rush but felt a little ignored, because other tables in close vicinity got better attention.

We ordered two appetizers, and a minute later she was asking for our entree orders. The appetizers came and two minutes later the entrees. Ugh!

We were immediately sat at their rooftop area &amp; excitedly looked thru the menu.

This was the perfect spot for our group as it had all the italian favourites we were craving including their signature mushroom truffle pasta. The calamari and pizzas were all great too. My one qualm is that their tomato sauce is way too sweet; almost ketchup like sometimes.\n\\\nGusto 101 has quite a lot of seating, including an outdoor patio and upper level seating, so we didn&#39;t have to wait for a table. \\'a0We were seated quickly and our server was pretty prompt with drinks. \\'a0We got several items:<br><br>Focaccia - could be warmer when brought out, it was just lukewarm. \\'a0Was good but could have been better had it not been lukewarm<br><br>Cavolo nero salad - \\'a0was very tasty, but for $16 for a salad was a pretty steep price<br><br>Americano burger - asked for medium, burger was well done and a bit dry. \\'a0Fries were delicious with the sauce<br><br>Bolognese - was the star out of all the dishes. \\'a0Pasta was al dente, but lots of grease (which also made it taste good).<br><br>Had to drink a lot of water when home, dishes were loaded with salt.\n\\\nFor me, this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. The food is amazing and fairly priced. <br><br>We went around 5:30 on a Thursday and got seated immediately (the website said they don&#39;t take reservations so we just walked in). We were seated on the upstairs patio and there was a lot of room, probably due to COVID restrictions as well. <br><br>For our app, we ordered the calamari fritti. It was amazing and the lemon aioli was delicious. We ate it so fast I forgot to grab a picture of it. <br><br>For our mains, we ordered the famous truffle mushroom pasta and the Diavola pizza.

From their octopus to their pastas!\n\\\nRidiculous $36 for two take out kale salads which consisted of 100 grams of shredded kale and some grated Parmesan! Total robbery, especially for take out. Will never go back! Try to support small businesses during these times, but not like this! Extremely disappointed - shame on you Gusto 101, you&#39;ve lost a loyal customer.\n\\\nGreat drinks and well-made pasta. The fettuccine was like silky ribbons. Carpaccio was so tasty . Nice ambience and great location. Easy to get to via subway or street car. Great bar area near the entrance where you get natural lighting if you come before sunset. There are two patios, one being on the ground level and the other being from the second floor providing an elevated view of the neighbourhood. The rooftop patio also has interesting features created from the skylights of the building.\n\\\nOrdered Uber. Pizza was delivered cold and lacked the toppings I had paid for. Called up the restaurant and a guy called Luigi (store manager) blamed Uber for the lack of quality and refused to make amends. Funny thing is the I could trace that Uber picked up and delivered within 15 mins of the restaurant marking it prepared. Poor form. Won&#39;t be coming back.\n\\\nThis place offers Southern Italian classic dishes, yet it really mesmerize me with the rustic interior design and ambience. It brings you back to Italy!

The food is mediocre and there were so many flies at the patio area. Had the Cavolo Nero (black kale salad) due to great reviews. It wasn&#39;t that great: sour and overpriced ($16). Shared a pizza and it was okay. We wanted to have time to talk but we felt rushed to order food and finish our food. The waitress told us that seating time was 1 hour and 45 minutes and she kept reminding us how much time we have left.\n\\\nI came here with a friend and had such a wonderful time. I received one of the best restaurant services I have ever had in a long time. Since we were a party of two on a Friday night we were nervous for the wait but were seated right away. There was an error made that was fixed and even received a complimentary dessert. Thank you Kerri for making our experience so amazing! I just want to say the food was amazing. We started with the house made bread which was delicious and the portion was huge for two people. For the main... do you even have to guess?! The mafaldi ai funghi, a true star!!! The sauce and noodles were absolutely delicious! I will definitely be back! We also had the olive oil cake which I recommend to anyone. Thank you gusto for a wonderful night.\n\\\nWhenever I&#39;m downtown, this is where I want to go for dinner... I just crave the black kale salad and the mushroom pasta all the time. It&#39;s so filling and hits the spot. <br><br>Every time we&#39;ve been here, it&#39;s been busy. Especially now during COVID-19 (hello future readers who have lived past this pandemic), there are fewer seating options and I see a lot of people doing take out. We&#39;ve been incredibly lucky. We came early each time so they always had a little table for us within minutes. Plus it helps that we know exactly what we want. <br><br>Food flies out of this kitchen quickly.

No, they give us space and are there once we need them. Perfect!<br><br>You have got to try the black kale salad (cavolo nero?). It&#39;s so good, their chef shared the recipe on CBC or some news channel a while back. I love it. Tangy, a little sweet, nutty, and all the freshness of black kale. Texture wise, it&#39;s soft and easy to chew through because it&#39;s been sitting in the citrusy dressing. Then that shaved parm on top. WHEW! <br><br>And then we go for the mushroom pasta. It looks like a deceptively small portion when you first see it. But the pasta is dense and chewy and the sauce is rich. You got the truffles, the mushroom, the umami deliciousness all around. It&#39;s exactly my type of pasta.<br><br>We&#39;ve also had pizza and other dishes which have all been amazing, but I am a creature of habit. I tend to return to the same dishes. <br><br>AND for the dessert, if they have olive oil cake on the menu, do give it a try. For anyone that hasn&#39;t had olive oil cake before, it tastes so good. great hit of strong flavoured olive oil in a dense cake with light, herby, sweet toppings like fresh thyme and gelato. It&#39;s perfect, I didn&#39;t think I would like it as much as I did. <br><br>Really worth coming in to take a look. Try it out. Book a reso if you plan to come after 7pm. It&#39;s a wonderful vibe, cute restaurant, great service, great food.\n\\\nI like Italian food. Quite interesting place, very nice people. Thank you so much!\n\\\nI&#39;m so glad that Gusto is still offering great take-out options during the covid pandemic. Definitely one of Toronto&#39;s great quality food venues, but I wish I could have experienced my food indoors again. Please take us back to when it was before lockdown.\n\\\nI&#39;ve always wanted to visit this highly rated restaurant, but never ended up going before things went off the rails. With restaurants struggling these days, I figured I would show support by giving takeout a try.<br><br>Let me cut straight to the chase: the mafalde al funghi is incredible. It&#39;s creamy, mushroom-y, truffle-y bliss. My favourite Italian place in Richmond Hill used to offer a mushroom pappardelle, but ever since the restaurant closed down a couple years ago, I&#39;ve been on the hunt for a worthwhile replacement. I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ve found it in the mafalde al funghi and I can barely wait to experience this dish in person when it&#39;s appropriate to do so.<br><br>I also ordered the rucola (arugula salad with parmesan and lemon vinaigrette), which was as expected.

Thankfully, Uber Eats refunded me for the dish. There was nothing wrong with the rigatoni, but it wasn&#39;t what I had ordered and I wasn&#39;t too impressed with it.<br><br>The tiramisu is a perfect way to round off your meal. It arrived in a large portion that serves 3-4. It&#39;s tasty and pretty good value. I would certainly order this again.\n\\\nAbsolutely love their food! Sometimes it&#39;s hard when you want an early dinner because there&#39;s always a line up. But on nights that you don&#39;t mind eating a bit late, this place is great! <br>Service and good are always consistently good!<br><br>Would highly recommend this place.\n\\\nAmazing Margherita Pizza. Best I&#39;ve had in Toronto so far! I&#39;ve tried margherita pizza in many other restaurants and they don&#39;t always use the best ingredients. This one truly tops the list, especially with their cheese. Will definitely come back for more.\n\\\nThis seemingly small place serves some delicious food. It looks small from the outside but is actually quite spacious on the inside. We went in early February, and were seated right away. <br><br>I ordered the ground sausage &amp; roasted red pepper pizza, and my best friend ordered the lamb meatballs. We also got an appetizer of the fresh bread (not complimentary). Everything was incredibly delicious. The service was great everyone was so polite. The pizza crust was the perfect texture of just a tiny crispy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside. The lamb meatballs&#39; flavour was very rich (and not too rich), and their sauce was to die for. <br><br>We left feeling extremely full, with tummies satisfied. I will definitely return to this restaurant in the future.\n\\\nFirstly, I loved the decor of the restaurant. It&#39;s a bit dark in there but the seating is minimalistic yet chic. My group was sat on the second level where glass pyramids sit as center pieces inside of a large square countertop for large groups. I ordered the Regina Margherita pizza. It contains cherry tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella and was absolutely delicious. I shall am not a fan of whole tomatoes but these were bright and delicious. The mozzarella was milky and stretchy and worked wel with the fresh basil on the pizza. The crust could have been cooked a little longer as it was not so charred on the bottom and the sauce ended up making the pizza a little fragile. It was a perfect balance of sweet, savory and tangy.

Fries were crispy and then Bruschetta just tasted amazing. In Mains, we tried their famous Truffle Mushroom Pasta and Melanzane Pizza. Both dishes just tasted heavenly. The base of Pizza was very thin and full of cheese. The Pasta was creamy and so yummy. We ended our meal with their Chocolate Cake and Tiramisu. Both of them were really good, especially the Tiramisu one. Overall, a great place to try some amazing Italian food. But it is a little costly. So, it might burn your pockets a little bit.\n\\\nMy boyfriend planned a birthday dinner for 17 friends this past Friday and we were all very happy with our meal. We were in a private wine cellar on the bottom floor and shared family style plates for each course. Family style set ups normally leave me a teeny bit hungry afterwards but not this time at all. As per usual, the highlight was the truffle pasta, which had us all thinking about it the next couple of days. The minimum spend was very reasonable and we would all definitely do it all again. Big shout out to our waitress - you were amazing!\n\\\nGreat food with great atmosphere. The lighting is very dim so good for dates! I went with a group of four girls for a friend&#39;s birthday and we were seated on the top level. \\'a0It was very cold at first due to all the windows but they turned up the heat eventually. \\'a0One party of four kept their coats on the whole time since they were seated next to the window.<br><br>Staff was friendly and attentive. \\'a0The food was great. Mushroom pasta had a great truffle flavour but by the end it was quite heavy. Still finished it though! The grilled octopus was tasty and the kale salad was flavourful with lots of cheese. The chocolate dessert was very dense and rich but good to share with another person.<br><br>Would come back and maybe try their burger next time!\n\\\nI hadn&#39;t been to Gusto in a long time and now I remember why. Their service just lacks so much, for the trendy atmosphere and vibe they execute. Went for brunch today with a friend (who had NEVER been before) and right when we walked In the hostesses didn&#39;t great us with a hello. We get seated upstairs, following the hostess who basically ran up as we quickly followed. We then approach a table of 6 that had to be taken apart because the \\'a0reso canceled. The Restaursnt wasn&#39;t even busy... so no one reset that table after the cancelation? Looked silly as we stood there waiting. We then sat and didn&#39;t get greeted by a server for 5 min or so. We looked around and \\'a0finally a gentleman came over to us loooking and sounding annoyed. I&#39;m not gonna lie, I was EXTREMELY unimpressed by this server so I asked him if he was taking care of us and he looked at me like I was dumb. Totally ruined our experience as he kept giving us attitude with our menu questions. I&#39;m getting aggravated just writing about it.

Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.<br><br>Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf&#39;s pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.<br><br>The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.<br><br>Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I&#39;m sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i&#39;ve tasted, just wasn&#39;t my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it&#39;s heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn&#39;t creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that&#39;s really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn&#39;t finished it :/\n\\\nNever disappointed, but never overly impressed at that, Gusto 101 is a solid location to keep on your radar of classic Italian restaurants in the city. Located in the heart of the Entertainment District, Gusto&#39;s space is impressive: rustic-industrial but not impersonal. The upstairs portion of the restaurant is particularly lively after hours, offering an experience that both defies the drear of the winter months and captures the warmth of the summer season. While dinner tends to err on the side of upscale, Gusto maintains a casual atmosphere with its rather affordable prices. Meanwhile, its $1/ounce of wine offer is certainly hard to beat.\n\\\nA solid spot for Italian - I now see why this place has so much hype around it. We didn&#39;t book reservations, but were able to get a bar seat upstairs. The space was super cool, and my family visiting from out of town loved it!<br><br>The bread was delicious, the salad and the pastas were amazing, and the dessert was perfect. I have nothing bad to say - overall a 5/5 for me. I will definitely be back!\n\\\nI love this restaurant. Ate out on the patio during the summer and the atmosphere was great, food phenomenal, service was good too. I ordered the kale salad (&#34;Cavolo Nero&#34; on menu) as the appetizer, which I underestimated at first but was clearly mistaken once I tried it. SO GOOD! The kale salad is a must try. For the main meal I ordered the truffle mushroom pasta (&#34;Mafalde Al Funghi&#34; on menu) ughhhh so good.

The atmosphere was amazing and the service was exceptional. I ordered and class of wine and it arrived at the table before the server even left! My family ordered the margarita pizza and the PATATE E PANCETTA was to die for. I ordered the COTOLETTA ALLA MILANESE. The chicken was lightly breaded and not oily, and the salad added a fresh taste to the dish. I would recommend Gusto 101 to everyone!!\n\\\nWhen I say the food is unreal here I mean it. This is the only yelp review I&#39;ve written and I felt like I could not leave the restaurant without letting the wold of yelp know how good this place is. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar, completely full restaurant. The open concept kitchen we watched the chefs prepare eat meal in front of the wood burning grill. We started with the burrata and bread, followed with Brussels, the Diavola pizza, and mushroom pasta. Unbelievable food. Some of the best I have ever had. I don&#39;t have a single complaint. The service was great. A real team effort. Plates didn&#39;t sit in front of once we cleaned them completely of course. And the tiramisu was so delicate and light. If you are in Toronto please go here!!\n\\\nThis could be my shortest review ever: get the mushroom pasta. Seriously, don&#39;t question it, just get it. It&#39;s absolutely heavenly. Even if you don&#39;t like mushrooms (like me) you will love this pasta. It&#39;s pretty much perfect.\n\\\nAfter hearing great things about Gusto 101 I finally had my turn to try it and I was not disappointed, AT ALL!<br><br>I really liked the rustic interior and the restaurant gave a more upscale casual vibe. I felt welcome in just my jeans and sweater. The staff was super friendly and assisted us happily. We had brought a birthday cake to celebrate our friends birthday and they gladly put it in their fridge, and even cut and served it to us after we sang happy birthday. It was returned in perfect condition (except for those slices we ate of course).<br><br>On top of the service and decor, the food was absolutely bomb! Our table of 4 shared the Cavalo Caesar Salad (kale caesar), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mushroom Brushcetta to start. The Cavalo caesar was tasty and every ingredient complimented eachother. I wasn&#39;t too heavy and tasted heavenly. The grilled octopus was tender and delicious. The mushroom bruchetta was also delicious and had lots of mushrooms on top.<br><br>For our mains we had the Calamarata (Spicy seafood pasta), Taliatelle (Bolognese ragu pasta) and the Mafalde Al Funghi (Mushroom Truffle Cream Sauce).

If you love cream pasta, and mushrooms you must try this. Combined with the truffle oil, it just brought my pasta experience to another level. The pasta itself was cooked al dente and complimented this rich sauce so well. I had a sample of the other 2 pastas which were very very good in their own right, but the mushroom pasta was the best in my opinion. If you&#39;re lactose intolerant, be wary though.<br><br>I&#39;m glad I finally got to try Gusto 101 and am looking forward to my next visit hopefully very very soon.\n\\\nUnfortunately, we didn&#39;t take any photos because we were too busy chatting and forgot shoot some photos. We tried almost all the dishes on the menu. Seriously doesn&#39;t worse even 10$ any dish. Pizza is naked) no toppings... daily specials like an appetizer; Kale salad is so exaggerated omg it is just KALE which becomes very fancy recently. Here come only corporate ppl with gift cards, I don&#39;t think anyone will pay for this crappy food from the pocket. If you still want to try tasteless food then come evening because of the interior. It is very cute especially evening, deemed lights makes the place very romantic. Overall food is unreasonably priced and tasteless.\n\\\nWe really enjoyed our time at this restaurant. We went on a Saturday night without a reservation and it was very crowded and we had to wait a while. It was dark, but the ambiance was nice. Our waiter was also nice and attentive. We both got pasta dishes and were very happy. I would definitely come back here and would recommend for a romantic date night out.\n\\\nFirst time at gusto 101, I heard so much good things about its dinner menu so I had also pretty high expectations on the brunch too. I would say it&#39;s a little overpriced for the food I was eating, we tried eggs in purgatorio, and tagiliata di manzo which is grilled flatiron steak and Romano beans. I never liked beans but liked the beans oN my plate, it&#39;s well seasoned and not mushy. However I asked for medium steak and I got fully cooked steak...... which is just, disappointed considering how popular this restaurant is. The tiramisu is very sweet, they charge 10 dollars for a very shallow piece, and the biscuits underneath is no where near soaked, maybe they took a modern twist on this dessert because it is NOT authentic at all. For those who recommended tiramisu in the reviews, I don&#39;t know if u actually have eaten authentic ones yet because this is just..... meh.Anyways, I will come back for non brunch, but I will avoid tiramisu for good.\n\\\nGreat food.

They probably deal with less waste because of how much they put on the plate lol which is good I guess. Service was as expected, prompt and polite. A bit disappointed they were out of the ragu lamb, that&#39;s the pasta that I really wanted to try. Their substitute was pork and beef and all their other pastas had pork in then already so I was pretty much limited to a plain red sauce pasta or the mushroom because I dont eat pork.\n\\\nI came here on a weekend for a late lunch around 2PM, and I was immediately seated. I was handed a brunch menu, and to be honest, most of the items looked quite ordinary and American; even though I didn&#39;t end up trying any of the main brunch items, I don&#39;t think I would come here for brunch. I ordered the banana bread after confirming the size of the dish (it&#39;s small). I didn&#39;t see any pastas on the brunch menu though, so I asked for it and was told there was only the mafalde which comes with a creamy mushroom sauce. I had looked on Yelp before going and knew that&#39;s the pasta I wanted, so I happily ordered that. I was asked whether I wanted both at the same time or banana bread first, and I said I&#39;ll take whatever&#39;s ready first. The food came out quickly, and the banana bread came first. It was light and fluffy, and I liked the pairing with the strawberry preserve. I don&#39;t know what the blob of cream was, so I didn&#39;t eat that. Before I could finish that, my pasta came, and it looked so good that I couldn&#39;t wait to finish my banana bread before having it, so I took a bite. It was delicious, wow. I was really impressed by that dish because the pasta itself was cooked perfectly, and it was so chewy. The sauce was very mushroom-y, and the cheese on top complimented the dish well too. I was so happy eating that, I would highly recommend it. My bill came out to be around $33 (CAD) post-tax which is definitely on the high side, but for the quality and quantity of food, it was worth it. Ambiance was comfortable and everything was clean; it wasn&#39;t too loud for hearing a conversation. Service was pleasant and friendly although I had to wait a while for my check. I would definitely recommend coming here for some good Italian food!\n\\\ntl;dr not too shabby! but you can do so much better.<br><br>Came here for my birthday with a few gal pals - we&#39;d been meaning to try the place out for ages.

After their food was once again edible, I tried some and wasn&#39;t impressed. The Pappardelle tasted undercooked and was plated in a lasagna style making it difficult to cut through, and the ragu itself was mediocre at best in terms of flavour. The Malfalde was gooey in consistency and I personally found the truffle cream sauce to be overpowering and not complimentary to this dish. Upon her first bite my friend immediately noted that the dish tasted exactly the same as the mushroom pasta at Trattoria Nervosa (a sister restaurant to Gusto). <br><br>As a fan of the other restaurants under the Gusto54 umbrella corporation (Chubby&#39;s &amp; PAI in particular) I was a little disappointed that their Italian dining experience didn&#39;t live up to the standards I would have expected from a place with such high reviews. <br><br>Sometimes ordering can be a hit or miss, and these were most definitely a miss. Our little group was in unanimous agreement - we&#39;d much rather be at Pizza Libretto or Grazie than here.\n\\\nThis is a fantastic establishment with embodies delicious Italian cuisine and a culture that resembles Italy. It has a really vibrant, open roof top and a nice, buzzing, dim indoor space. Both areas are loud and roudy and give a great environment to hang, grab food and grab a drink with friends.<br><br>I got the infamous Mafalde Al Funghi which is basically their mushroom, truffle pasta! The shape of Mafalde is perfect for picking up the super delicious truffle cream sauce and making each bite so good as you soak in that savoury, creamy sauce. They could&#39;ve definitely plated the food better and I was originally skeptical when it arrived. But when I had it I was surprised how simple and elegant the dish was, yet it was so tasty. I wish the portions were bigger though for the $22 I had to pay!<br><br>They have their own house wine on tap for $1 per ounce! So it was $5 for a glass of wine, which is ridiculously cheap and it tasted pretty reasonable as well! (Another thing that resembles Italy! Cheap wine while you eat your meal!)<br><br>All in all, I enjoy this restaurant and I&#39;ll definitely come back again!\n\\\nMy favourite dish to order here is their mushroom truffle pasta (Mafalde Ai Funghi).

Very rich, creamy and flavourful! A bit pricey but worth a try if you come here. Their octopus (Polipo) was okay though, probably wouldn&#39;t order that one again. Their kitchen is open concept so it was cool to peek through to watch the chefs cook.\n\\\nWe traveled into Toronto for the weekend from NY and were seeking a modern Italian cuisine. Gusto 101 exceeded our expectations for a number of reasons. The wait was approximately 45min which gave us plenty of time to explore the surrounding neighborhood which we enjoyed. We were quickly seated after arriving back. Once ordered, dinner arrived sooner than expected and was phenomenal both in taste and presentation. Further, our server Benjamin was incredible. He not only offered helpful insight for our weekend vacation stay but went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful experience. On the way out, we accidentally left our helpful map our hotel provided but Benjamin ran out and chased us halfway down the street to return it! <br><br>We highly recommend and will be sure to return upon our next visit!\n\\\nBy far my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto!! I have ordered almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed! The $1 for 1oz wine is a great perk as well.

All great options :)\n\\\nMy family and I were in Toronto on Saturday. \\'a0As I love Steampunk and Italian food we decided to try Gusto 101. \\'a0It was excellent. \\'a0The atmosphere was relaxed and interesting. \\'a0The food was amazing. \\'a0We shared their Mushroom Bruschetta and it was delicious. \\'a0I had Mafalde Al Funghi with protobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms and truffle cream sauce. \\'a0Honestly, it was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. \\'a0My son had a Marghertia Pizza. \\'a0He enjoyed it very much. \\'a0And my husband had the Rigatoni All&#39;Amatriciana. \\'a0Very good. \\'a0the staff were attentive and friendly and the prices were reasonable. \\'a0I hope to go back there soon.\n\\\nThis place is great if you&#39;re willing to splurge. It&#39;s very dark and they rely mainly on candlelight so bring your glasses! Also I had a falling out with the friendI came to this establishment with and while that doesn&#39;t really matter I just wanted to put it out there\n\\\nThe mushroom pasta is something I could eat everyday, but I would say that the octopus appetizer could use improvement. It was nicely cooked and tender but this appetizer comes in at the price of an entree, so I feel that for the price ($22 I think), we should get more than 5 small tentacles. As we were waiting outside, the hostess had asked us if we wanted to be in the quieter section and we said yes. We were directed to go upstairs, yet it was still so loud that we were yelling at each other. Maybe I&#39;m just old, but I would prefer not<br>to have a yelling match over dinner. Overall, a lovely space and I would return to try a few of their other offerings.\n\\\nAmazing vibe with wonderful food. This is a place I would surely recommend to anyone who likes good Italian food. It&#39;s also at a reasonable price, with good food and cheap house wine.\n\\\nNo wonder this place is so busy almost everyday,every hour, every season. Good service, good food &amp; reasonable pricing ( for downtown core location).<br><br>The bad? The wait time. But I hit the jackpot tonight, without much wait time. <br><br>Too loud for a decent conversation.

I booked them online and had specified a lot of things. I tend to do that all the tome when they ask. But... I have seen a few restaurants which actually read or pay attention to those instructions and follow, but the Gusto 101, not only each of them carefully but also showed that they care by accommodating each of my request and showcasing it while we were onsite. Example: I mentioned that I am pregnant and vegetarian, so the lady who served us, without asking told whats vegetarian and safe to eat in pregnancy!!! I was so impressed!!! She also remembered that its my Hubby&#39;s birthday and she connected to me finding a time when he was on a toilet trip to do a little candle ceremony over the dessert to totally surprise him. I didn&#39;t have to approach her.<br>Apart from it, in general the service was par excellence. So weather its serving the food, special requests, refills and making sure someone is looking for us all the time we never had to wait to get the attention. They were more than 1 people watching for us.<br><br>Ambiance: 5 - we did dine @ upstairs patio, and it was beautiful! The place is super big, they also have a beautiful private party room un the basement, wine cellar themed. <br><br>Food: 3 - so here is where I think \\'a0they have a little room for improvement or it was just by chance that our dish was not so good. Can&#39;t say. So we ordered mushroom pasta : the sauce tasted so awesome but the downside: there was a very little sauce and the pasta was a little more harder than Al-dente. Portion could be a little more as well.<br>I did snoop around and saw , other people had more sauce . So I don&#39;t know. \\'a0<br>Pizza was good not the best but nothing wrong. <br>The bread (3.99$) was good. The dessert was average although i loved the salt and chocolate combinations but it was-not balanced somewhere the salt was a little to much, I guess they have to be more careful while they sprinkle it or find another way to serve it. <br>Hubby loved both of their house wines ( red &amp; white) and the idea of 1$ per Oz. And they made me Virgin Mojito and priced it pretty decent! <br><br>I must it is great place for personal celebrations and special dates.<br>But we are willing to go again to give it try a second time.\n\\\nThis review is for drinks only. <br><br>My boyfriend and I stopped in Saturday morning for a drink.

Superb service, great ambiance and fantastic food. <br>Planned a small surprise birthday dinner for my sister. She listed this as one of her favourite eateries in the city so I arrived early with balloons. <br>The front entrance staff were very kind to allow me to get a table for four ...with balloons LOL. <br>Wait staff were equally friendly and very fast. Service was excellent. <br>Food: my sister highly enjoys their kale salad. I thought it was great - massaged kale shredded with some sort of lemon vinaigrette and topped with Parmesan shavings. <br>I spied the pizzas making their way to the tables of others so I went with a \\'a0prosciutto and arugula option. It was delicious. Perfect combination of flavours with a light, crispy crust. <br><br>Definitely recommend for a nice, light meal with friends. A little loud for a date night but groups seem to like it (there&#39;s a second level and a patio during the summer months).\n\\\nThe restaurant has a unique, authentic feel to it with wooden tables and decor. I would recommend the 2nd floor during the day, as it is much brighter with the sun roof and light coming in. We ordered the margherita pizza and fungi pasta. This is my first time trying mushroom and truffle pasta, and it tasted amazing! It smelled heavenly, and it was rich and creamy which I love. Well worth the trip!\n\\\nExcellent service and food despite breaking my heart. <br><br>Went in yesterday for lunch after watching a TIFF film with the girls (make sure you check out Just Mercy with Michael B Jordan!) and got a nice seat on the upper patio despite the restaurant being quite busy. <br><br>We ended up having the burger, avocado toast and the uova in camicia. All were excellent. Although the avocado toast portion was small, it was absolutely delicious. Keep in mind there is a very spicy drizzle that comes on the dish so if you don&#39;t like spicy make sure your server knows. I , however was licking my fingers! You may need two orders for a group of 4 because only 3 smallish slices of bread. <br><br>Now for the sad part....<br>This was my first visit and I&#39;ve had it bookmarked forever and was really there to try the pizza and pastas. Of course we get there and the pizza oven was down and they don&#39;t serve pastas (except 1 special) on their brunch menu. Yikes!

The branzino is hands down the best I&#39;ve had in the city. My only complaint is they don&#39;t have draft beer. The washroom is coed, so heads up if that bothers you.\n\\\nProbably my favourite Italian place in Toronto - definitely coming back for great food and drinks. Would recommend Gusto for date night or drinks and dinner with the girls. <br><br>We came in around 7:30PM Saturday night and were seated relatively quickly. I ordered the Mushroom and Truffle pasta, boyfriend got the T Bone steak, and we had the beef tartare as our app. <br><br>Drinks were so so good, I got the dragon fruit and watermelon cocktail and it tasted like juice but I could taste just the subtle flavour of hard liquor. <br><br>Pasta was perfectly aldente and so much mushroom and truffle flavour, it brought me back to the truffle pasta I had in Florence. T Bone was great, flavour was really good and the addition of mushrooms was a nice touch to balance the strong flavour of steak. Beef tartare was surprisingly delicious, there was a truffle infused sauce that you could mix the beef with and place it on the baguette chip and not was that heavenly. <br><br>Come here if you&#39;re looking for great Italian food and cozy vibes.\n\\\nOne of my favorite Italian restaurants in Toronto. I loved Mafalde al funghi. Great taste!\n\\\nGreat place for dinner! Casual atmosphere with really great food! <br><br>We sat in the patio area and had a few of their dishes. We had the cacio e pepe, tomahawk steak, margherita pizza, broccolini, and their rucola salad. Everything was really good! The steak was cooked perfectly, nice and tender. The rucola salad was fresh and love the dressing on it. Finished off with tiramisu and panna cotta... both very good. <br><br>The service was really good and they have a nice wine menu. Would love to go back to try some other things on the menu.\n\\\nHusband and I came here for brunch on a Sunday. We were seated upstairs in nice weather, and everyone from the hosts and server were very nice though not overly attentive (we had to flag our server down a couple of times). It wasn&#39;t crowded and the fresh air was nice.

Quality over quantity any day. <br><br>The steak was a nice surprise--flank (I think is what they used) tends to be lean, but the chef treated it very well so that it was juicy and flavorful. The egg was perfect, and though I have hated beans all my life, these smelled so good and were seasoned so well that I actually ate a few bites before the texture triggered my dislike. The peppers probably could&#39;ve been saut\\'e9ed for a shorter amount of time, but now I&#39;m just being picky. There were many elements on the dish, but all worked well together. <br><br>We had hoped that the panna cotta would remind us of our trips to Italy, but it was quite different. This felt more of a pudding or a custard, and the preserves they used were overpowering for our non-sweet tooth. We both had to rinse our mouths after. <br><br>The only real issue we came across was finding a short, dark hair in the pasta. We opted not to be fussy and didn&#39;t notify our server or send the plate back, but it seems that the restaurant owner monitors the reviews here, so perhaps this can help the expeditor be more cognizant of issues like this.\n\\\nThe neighbourhood&#39;s favourite Italian restaurant - $1 an ounce wine, truffle mushroom pasta and Nero salad - consider yourself satisfied!\n\\\nAmazing italian food- this is coming from an Italian from New Jersey. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and we got to sit at the bar facing the cooks which was a fun sight to see. The house wine by the ounce was great. I had the agnello bolognese which was to die for. Definitely would recommend to a friend.\n\\\nThis was our favorite meal while visiting Toronto. The MAFALDE AI FUNGHI was delicious and has some serious mushroom flavor. Sparkling Ros\\'e9 was refreshing and inexpensive. Perfect for a summer evening drink! The DIAVOLA PIZZA was full of flavor and a bit spicy but not overpowering. There is a wait for this place on weekends but definitely worth it.

Gusto is a a beautiful restaurant located in downtown Toronto. My friend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. There wasn&#39;t even a queue to get in, which was a pleasant surprise.<br><br> The restaurant&#39;s dinning area is split into two levels. We sat upstairs in their gorgeous rooftop area, it kind of reminded me of a greenhouse. The service here was great as well. Our waiter was polite and very attentive. <br><br>I ordered a mimosas ($11 I think) and the eggs in purgatorio which came with a side of grilled sourdough bread with a spicy tomato like sauce on top. The meal was delicious! The flavor was perfect! The eggs do come runny which I normally don&#39;t like but went really well with this meal. I&#39;d definitely recommend trying this place out! There dinner menu looks just as yummy especially if you&#39;re in the mood for Italian.\n\\\nSuper delicious. I had the gluten free pasta and it was honestly one of the better pastas I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life. <br><br>Super awesome find, was recommended this place by a lot of friends. If you&#39;re staying close by like we were on vacation, check this place out. The ambience is super cool, definitely a nice date spot or a small group of friends!\n\\\nA Toronto staple. Must try the kale salads !!! If not downtown go to trattoria nervosa !!!\n\\\nThis place was great! We wanted to go to a rooftop restau down the street but they were booked and then we found this gem! There were surprisingly few ppl on the roof (plenty down stairs). I got the omelette (not my favorite bc the mushrooms over powered but the salad and potatoes were very tasty) and my friend got the eggs in purgatorio which she like. I also got a 5 oz pour of the house Pinot ($5) and she got a mimosa ($11). Service was great and quick.\n\\\nOne of my favorite spots downtown, especially in the summer. Can&#39;t go wrong with anything on this menu. Recommend their red wine sangria as well\n\\\nBeen here a couple years ago and I remember it was very good but my recent visit left me very disappointed. My visit during lunch on Tuesday the 30th started with a very rude hostess. She couldn&#39;t even bother to help me to my seat she just said, you can look around for your friend (who had already arrived). I asked her if she would help me and she said to look myself. I don&#39;t think these girls get any training or maybe they&#39;re told to be snobby and lack hospitality skills. <br><br>We ordered a pizza which was soggy and the kale salad was not flavourful at all.

And when I saw some pictures on Yelp, I told my group that we have to come here. <br>Gusto 101 is super crowded so basically it is really hard to get a table without a reservation but if you are willing to share a big table with other group, you can be seated immediately, My group decided to share a table so we got seated immediately inside right in front of entrance. The only thing is it got sooo hot I never sweat but I was sweating like a pig. Wish they find a way to cool inside. <br>Food came out and I LOVED my mushroom pasta and the best pasta Ive ever had. At first the dish seems small but the pasta is thick and long so it does fill you up. I had a bite of the pizza and usually I don&#39;t like plain magherita pizza but it was pretty nice. Since I am from Detroit, I won&#39;t be easy to come back here every time I crave this, so I bought some ingredients to recreate Mushroom pasta but we will see how that&#39;s gonna turn out haha. Will definitely recommend to anyone here!\n\\\nGusto 101 is a must whenever we come to Toronto. <br>It&#39;s as close as it can get of real italian cuisine. <br><br>The mafalde el funghi are to die for. <br><br>The restaurant also has a great atmosphere.\n\\\nI&#39;ve heard many good things about this place and after finally trying it, I now understand why.

The server we had seemed really bored and not attentive. He came by once to ask us if we wanted to clear the food and we were only halfway finished and still eating....it was just bizarre. When we were getting the bills, he stood there texting on his phone instead of handing us the terminals. We sat there awkwardly waiting for him to finish.\n\\\nSuch a great spot to sit on the patio. \\'a0I ordered the MALFALDE AL FUNGHI - it was perfectly al dente, but wasn&#39;t sold on the sauce. It wasn&#39;t truffle-y enough and kind of just tasted like Campbell&#39;s cream of mushroom soup (which in my memory is delicious, but also much cheaper than what I paid). Next time, I&#39;ll definitely get a pasta (such amazing texture) but maybe not this one.\n\\\nDelicious Italian food ! The patio is pretty fun as well.

The place was packed. The restaurant was out of bread and beer. The main course was served before the appetizer..the main was cold and tastefree. The tables were placed so close to each other that guy next to me was constantly talking loud. I will not recommend this place to anyone.\n\\\nGreat scene, location, vibes, &amp; FOOD. They have both an outdoor patio &amp; a rooftop, and if you&#39;re not lucky enough to enjoy that, their inside seating is just as great! Pizza is amazing. Brussel sprouts were outstanding. The Mushroom truffle pasta, TO DIE FOR.\n\\\nExcellent service and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the signature truffle pasta and would ecstatically recommend this to anyone. It&#39;s their signature dish. The drinks from the bar were expertly crafted.

The sauce was very rich in flavour, really creamy and very filling! Also got the spinach pizza to share with my friends and it tasted really good and cheesy. Would definitely come back for their pasta and maybe take advantage of their $1 an ounce wine deal too!\n\\\nLove this place for their house wine and mushroom pasta! I come here often for these staples. The red wine is a $1 an ounce and well worth it! It&#39;s a great spot if you are craving Italian. I would recommend to make reservations and sit on the second floor rooftop patio.\n\\\nGusto 101 (Toronto). <br>*<br>*<br>There is a reason why Gusto has been on a pedastal in my mind since I last came for dinner, maybe 7 years ago. So delicious, great space, awesome house wine for $1/oz. <br>*<br>Prosciutto Pizza - delicious flavours, very thin pizza which was hard to grasp but worth it because the toppings are so well balanced. The crust was crisp and light. So good. <br>*<br>Grilled Octopus - texture was on point, very nicely cooked. Not chewy at all. Interesting dollops of flavours surround it and make for a pretty plate. Wish there was more potatoes underneath! I love potatoes. <br>*<br>Mushroom pasta - highlight of the night for me. Truffle flavour was not too much/overpowering, sauce was exquisitely mushroomie, pasta was freaking al dente af like it was the most perfectly cooked pasta. It was thicker than usual too, I appreciated the chewiness to contrast the creamy sauce. I wish the serving size was larger! I think I could eat two of these on my own. *drool*. <br>*<br>Overall, so glad they were open on Canada Day and our original plan had fallen through and this landed on our lap/in our bellies. Always such a pleasure to dine at @gusto101to no matter the occasion. 9/10.\n\\\nOnly had a few dishes for brunch and they were okay. Will likely come back to try more. <br>Note the place is always packed.....\n\\\nThis is, hands-down, my favourite Italian joint downtown.

The cavolo nero is a light and zesty kale salad, that is topped with shaved Parmesan and lightly toasted pine nuts. This salad is an absolute dream, especially on a hot day. I&#39;ve tried recreating it at home, but Gusto has a way with it that I&#39;ll sadly never replicate! The mafalde funghi is just as impressive. The creamy mushroom sauce contains layer upon layer of mushroomy flavour. If you like mushrooms, this is the dish for you! Unsurprisingly, these dishes were a hit with my family! <br><br>We also tried a couple of new things: the branzino fish and margarita pizza. The branzino was crispy on the outside and light and flaky on the inside. It was so unfortunate that we were all sharing, otherwise I could finish it all by myself! The margarita pizza was not as epic but it was still a solid pizza! The crust was thin and crispy, the toppings fresh but not overwhelming with flavour. It tasted just the way a margarita pizza should taste.<br><br>The dessert: the coffee was epic in every sense of the word. When it arrived at the table, everyone commented on how the coffee must have been really good. It was brown and frothy. Dark and rich. You knew you were getting real Italian coffee. We paired our coffees with the cannoli, which to be honest, were not the best I&#39;ve ever had (shoutout to L&#39;Unita) but they hit the spot! <br><br>Verdict: head over to Gusto for lunch or dinner. Grab a seat inside or on the rooftop patio.

It is not uncommon to be told that you will have to wait 45 mins at the door. I suggest getting here before the dinner buzz comes in (and I promise it&#39;s worth it). The atmosphere is lively, the restaurant is industrial chic, and the service is impeccable. <br><br>As most will note, the mafalde ai funghi is a must try. The truffle cream sauce is to die for.

Will be coming back again soon.\n\\\nGreat place, great upstairs rooftop, solid mushroom pasta that I wound up craving even after. They have many good options too. Lovely place to hang on a summer day.\n\\\nIt was my sisters birthday and we decided to come by Gusto&#39;s. The upper seating area is what makes this place very special. It has a very bright and open atmosphere. We got a few drinks, of course there&#39;s no way we&#39;d pass on the sangria. It was very good, more fruity than usual. For myself, I decided that I&#39;d have the margarita pizza. Pretty basic compared to the other items on the menu but it was so delicious. The red sauce was sweet and the thin dough was not overly chewy like other pizzerias. I did have a taste of the tuscan fries and they were pretty good but there&#39;s nothing too basic about those sides. To top off the meal I got the tiramisu, which was not bad but it did have a weird consistency. I found it a bit to thick and chewy. To sum up, Gusto&#39;s serves top quality food in a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n\\\nGusto101 is one of my go-to restaurants and never disappoints. It is usually packed but the food, vibes, and cute patio are worth it.<br><br> Their signature pasta dish, the mafalde al funghi is a bit over hyped but is so creamy and delicious. Another hidden gem is their lasagna which I got as one of their specials of the day. You also can&#39;t go wrong with $1/oz house wine!\n\\\nNice place to eat, great food and has a good amount of items on the menu. If you intend on going for brunch, the earlier the better as it&#39;s always busy at Gusto 101.\n\\\nHad a great time at Gusto101 with my family for a weekend bday brunch. The service was excellent!

Ok, the bread tho! I love bread and had to stop from eating the entire basket before my meal arrived. \\'a0 We all ordered the burger and fries which was thumbs up and filling (I took half home with me. I probably should have backed off the bread basket!\\uc0\\u8205 ). \\'a0My cousin&#39;s tiramisu dessert also arrived with candle and four spoons because we all needed to sample it (it was delicious btw).<br><br>Loved the friendly, laidback vibe of this spot. It was busy but I didn&#39;t feel like I was in a super loud busy place at all. <br><br>We got there at 11:30 Sunday brunch session. For popular brunch and dining spots in the city (especially when there is sunshine and large patio available...) I try to go to brunch early so I can enjoy the space before it starts getting super busy around 12!and 1pm. Gusto101 was no exception. It&#39;s spacious with a front patio, main and upper level spaces and the place was a steady hum of conversation and people through the lunch hour. <br><br>I did have trouble making my reservations for 4 online - the system only seemed to allow for bookings of 3 and not 4. I had to call the restaurant directly. My call was returned quickly and I got it done. <br><br>This was my first time there and will have to return again before the summer is up.<br><br>The washrooms are downstairs so if you or your companion has mobility challenges I would suggest you contact the restaurant first to check out how accessible the space on a whole is. <br><br>Hope this is helpful!\n\\\nWe arrived on time for our Monday 11:30am reservation - party of 7. At around noon, the restaurant was PACKED (mostly working professionals) - and rightfully so! Food, service, and vibe were all 5 stars in my book.<br><br>We went a little overboard with the apps for the table: <br>* house-baked foccacia bread bucket x 2 - seriously addicting, but would taste even better if it was complimentary :P<br>* burrata served with sweet heirloom tomatoes and fragrant olive oil<br>* mushroom bruschetta (one per person) - MUST-GET!! cheesy, crunchy, and full of umami flavor<br><br>For entrees, most of us ordered the signature pasta dish: truffle funghi, which was creamy, indulgent, and perfect for carb-lovers. Portion was generous, so I&#39;d recommend sharing esp. if you plan to go ham on the starters like we did.<br><br>Service was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. For example, they were able to serve 7 pieces of bruschetta even when standard order came in 3 pieces. We had a complicated check split request, and they showed no qualms about it. I&#39;m looking forward to carb-loading here again the next time I&#39;m in town.\n\\\nThis place never disappoints. \\'a0The pasta is cooked like I grew up with....al dente. \\'a0Had the mushroom pasta with the octopus app and really liked the olive tapenade the best.\n\\\nCame here for brunch and", "doc_id": "882d58c9-4a7f-48d0-9bd2-4b2e92b8ffc8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "83a81538652af83e529de04c8c17960242af3d6a18f45f1447729ba32690dcc2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 154696, "end": 158200}, "relationships": {"1": "e38a0afd-f85c-4e7b-abca-e23e665cfa7e", "2": "11cd3fc2-391f-4a55-a63a-fc07501e3d5d", "3": "3b561c15-9bb0-49b9-b813-a9df99fa8e10"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b561c15-9bb0-49b9-b813-a9df99fa8e10": {"__data__": {"text": "and perfect for carb-lovers.
