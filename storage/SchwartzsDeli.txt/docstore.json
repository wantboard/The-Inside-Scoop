The level of unprofessionalism displayed by the staff was truly shocking. From the moment we stepped foot into the restaurant, it was clear that our presence was an inconvenience to them.\n\nThe guy manning the grill seemed to take pleasure in cutting us off whenever we attempted to place our orders. It was as if our requests were an inconvenience to his day. We were forced to repeat our order countless times, desperately trying to communicate our preferences, only to be met with blatant disregard.\n\nTo make matters worse, when our food finally arrived, we discovered that two orders of fries were missing. When we brought this to the attention of the same guy, he responded with an attitude that was not only disrespectful but also borderline offensive. He had the audacity to insinuate that we had never placed  the order for the missing fries in the first place.

We got a table at the back. Looking at all the photos on the wall shows the history of the business. Wow....we ordered the Medium fatty sandwich, fries, cherry coke and a pickle. (Wife is a pickle monster). The pickle was crispy and tart. Fries were fresh, hot and crunchy. Cherry coke was recommended by our server but I could of done without it. The sandwich was huge. First bite was amazing. Bread was fresh & had good chew. The meat melted in my mouth. Was mildly disappointed the flavour of the meat was very mild. Expected more flavour. (The sandwich at Katz's Delicatessen had significantly more flavour, but at double the cost).  Definitely worth the short wait. Will be back.\nAmazing food, great portions, awesome taste. This is a must place if you're visiting Montreal!!!\n\"Went here because of the hype, and sure. Why not. The meat is definitely worth it. Cooked until basically falling apart--it does that thing that I believe is the best part about meat, where its cut along the bias and the strands of muscle are severed and come apart in pieces. Body horror aside, its REALLY easy to eat this sandwich though it doesn't look like it will be when they set it in front of you. They're not big sandwiches. You might be tempted to order two. Don't. You'll die. Get a side.\n\nYou can order a variety of sides like fries, pickles, peppers, etc. I got a pickle. It's HUGE. And more on the dill side then the garlic side. It was crispy and a good bright balance to the thick darkness of the meat. We also got fries and they were fine. Not my kind of fry.  square cut and potatoey - good. Crisped just enough to say they were fried - not good. I like a crunchier edge to my fry.\n\nThe star of the show to me was the black cherry pop. I could drink that for days.

The smoked meat sandwich is pretty amazing.\nBest smoked meat\n\"I recently had the misfortune of visiting Schwartz' Deli, and I must say it was a highly disappointing experience. From the moment we stepped foot inside, we were greeted by an incredibly rude old male waiter on the restaurant side who seemed to have forgotten the meaning of customer service.\n\nAs soon as we entered, he barked at us to wait outside without any explanation or courtesy. When we politely informed him that we wanted takeaways, he dismissed us with a dismissive wave of his hand, as if it was our fault for not being able to read the invisible sign indicating the takeaway side. His condescending attitude and lack of professionalism were simply unacceptable.\n\nAfter enduring this unpleasant encounter, we proceeded to the takeaway side where we were thankfully met with a different set of staff who were friendly and accommodating. They served us promptly and with a smile, which was a stark contrast to the initial encounter.\n\nI have to admit, the smoked meat we ordered was pretty good. It had a nice flavor and was reasonably tender. However, I cannot overlook the fact that our overall experience was marred by the terrible service we encountered at the beginning.\n\nFirst impressions matter, and Schwartz' Deli failed miserably in that regard. The behavior of the waiter on the restaurant side was not only off-putting but also reflective of the establishment's overall lack of customer-oriented values.\n\nBased on the initial encounter, I am left with no choice but to give Schwartz' Deli a one-star rating. It's a shame that the quality of their food was overshadowed by the unprofessionalism and rudeness exhibited by one of their staff members. With numerous other dining options available, I would advise potential patrons to think twice before subjecting themselves to such a disappointing experience.\"\n\"A little pricey for what you get.\nOne pickle is $3.5. Too much for a pickle. Mine was not even as big as the guy at the bar or the people beside me. I'll bring my own pickle and coleslaw next time. The sandwich was good but pricey as well. A can of pop expensive.\"\nGreat smoked meat and fixings.", "doc_id": "d0395cbd-009f-4ea6-b6ce-8a0a4a46b96f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "982a665fb513e130c485939d2ba7910fd0cca6a2cd65a6f9018e14ee8e4b0f26", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 20057, "end": 22572}, "relationships": {"1": "48d9715e-1bd3-485a-a456-2df99aca63ee", "2": "8c693464-df42-4381-a8ad-a0b36724f715"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
