While I understand perfectly that all requests cannot be satisfied, I believe I deserved to get a response. Instead, it  was quite underwhelming to discover that we were assigned a table farthest from the view as one can possibly imagine. The meal is worth 350usd / capita. At this price tag, we deserved to be provided this critical piece of information especially when we ask for it\n- The room was very hot. For that reason, I have removed my jacket - and was still wearing a very decent / formal shirt. Immediately, the manager came to me to ask in a quite rigid / uncompromising way to put on my jacket again. Being surrounded with rules and lectured when eating is very un-Michelin, believe me\nFor these two reasons, I can only recommend this place as a very nice albeit old fashioned American restaurant, but certainly not as a Michelin restaurant. I believe they do not deserve their star\"\nBeautiful views, good music, and you get good options with the prefix menu.\nAmazing location, food is great except the desserts too sugary and heavy and too much quantity. appetizers and main courses are amazing so is service.\nWe celebrated our 10th anniversary here.

The wait staff avoided our table after. They would not check on us. They just starred and whispered amongst themselves.

He had the chilled shellfish (excellent) and I had the burrata and melon salad. It was magnificent.  We both had the beef and shared the chocolate brooklyn bridge for dessert.  The staff were knowledgeable and paced our meal perfectly. The dining area had spectacular views. The wine list top notch. Yes, it is expensive, but in my opinion,  worth it. A little tip: wear or bring comfortable shoes and walk back over the brooklyn bridge. It's a longer walk- about an hour- but the views are wonderful!\nPrix fixe for $190/person with dusty plates & sporty wine glasses. It's bold for them to do this. I bet they are going to add 25% gratuity without telling you. I left before they could rob me clean\nProbably my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, the River Cafe is located under the Brooklyn Bridge and has magical views of the city from the restaurant. I've eaten here on two or three occasions, the food has always been great, the service and dining room is fantastic as well. If your looking for a really cool special occasion type dining experience, the River Cafe is definitely a great place to consider.\nRomantic, iconic views, tasty food, great service.

A 3-course menu is served in no time, the staff makes a hasty impression, the atmosphere is not relaxed. When we ask if a taxi can be called, we are referred to the staff at the exit, where you will then be waiting for 15 minutes. I don't think that's service. On top of the price of the menu came an 18% gratuity fee plus over $100 service??? Not recommended\n\n(Original)\nDit is geen Michelin ster waard helaas.
