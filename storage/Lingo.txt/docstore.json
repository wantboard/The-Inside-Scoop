The pricing is so fair but the food is elevated, well executed, and absolutely delicious. <br><br>It may be a little out of the way but you should not miss the chance to dine here.\nThanks Lingo! Food and service (we sat at the bar) were 10/10. Def recommend. The veggie fried rice, asparagus and miso eggplant were amazing.\nLingo opened up very recently and my friends and I came here for our girls birthday celebration. All the staff were really friendly and super helpful when we were looking at the menu. We tried a lot of things on their menu but would love to try all the other dishes next time since everything we ordered was delicious. Some of my favorites were the smoked tamago sando, homemade milk bread, albacore tuna, steak tartare and you HAVE to get the lingo beef pie. My friend had a wonderful time here and had a nice surprise with the desserts (which all were delicious by the way). I highly recommend this new gem spot!\nExcellent new restaurant in Greenpoint! We dropped in about a week after opening and had an absolutely phenomenal meal. Particular stand out dishes were the crispy cauliflower and the beef pie. Will absolutely be going back soon.\nWent on a Friday night for my birthday dinner and overall, was ok. Please work on the kinks and family friendliness.<br><br>Decor - lovely place, very bright and hopefully they make use of the outdoor space in the back.<br><br>Food - decent, some hits and some were just ok. The milk bread could have been softer and the chicken was just fine and bordering on dry.

We were not the only table with a young child and they had no high chairs. I know its a new restaurant but this is pretty standard. Big miss given how many families live in the area.\nTo start off, this place is decorated very tastefully... from the flowers and plants, to the ceiling lights... everything was simply beautiful. <br><br>I did come with a 11 month old baby, and since I went so early on after they opened, they didn&#39;t have a high chair, and their booster seat wouldn&#39;t balance on their curvy chairs. Not a big deal for me since my baby sometimes doesn&#39;t want to sit in a high chair anyway (unless it&#39;s a nice high chair - she doesn&#39;t like the standard rectangular wood ones). Also we did make the reservation day of, so didn&#39;t give the restaurant enough of a heads up. But if you&#39;re coming with a baby, I would maybe call in advance and see if they&#39;ve gotten a high chair :) <br><br>Smoked tamago sando ($13) - every part of this was cooked well, and was delicious<br><br>Grilled oyster chawanmushi ($14) - comes with 2 grilled oysters on metal skewers, and a dashi custard.

I find it \u00a0hard to find a restaurant that is consistently good across all dishes I order, but Lingo definitely hit it out of the ballpark!\nThe best!! Emily and team are at it again. I visited the restaurant last week and will definitely be back. You can&#39;t go wrong but make sure you try the beef pot pie, the steak tartare and the crispy potatoes. I&#39;m still thinking about the curry deliciousness of the beef pot pie. Cocktails are fantastic too! They play great music but still very easy to have a conversation there. The restaurant is right on the water so we walked our meal off on the piers while overlooking the manhattan skyline.\nCozy new restaurant presenting Beautiful &amp; delish dishes &amp; Amazing cocktails (Lingo!) Cheers to Dynamic duo Chef Emily &amp; Chef Hun\nWe were excited to try this new restaurant in Greenpoint and were happy we did. Service was friendly. The space was inviting. And the food was amazing. The tortelloni, smashed potatoes, and albacore tuna were major highlights but it was truly all very good. Excited to come back!\nNew spot from chef Emily Yuen, formerly of Bessou, located on the far end of Greenpoint Avenue with lots of other great restaurants on the block.<br><br>Start with very good Milk Bread and the Smoked Tamago Sando. Don&#39;t miss the Lingo Beef Pie for your main course. Would definitely be down to come back for brunch once it starts.\n\nAmazing place, great playful flavors, perfectly matched dishes and super friendly staff! All very reasonable priced\nReally good restaurant in Greenpoint ! Everything was tasty ( special mention for the clams, they were delicious !). The ingredients are fresh and good quality.  Prices are a little expensive but we are in NYC, this is not surprising. The staff is kind and dedicated, the place is nicely decorated. We will come back for sure \ud83d\ude0a\nI really wanted to like it but honestly, most of the dishes just fell short. The albacore that I figured would be a layup was not great. The side sauce was great but the crisp it is lays upon has a weird texture that comes off as stale bread (even if it\u2019s not). It could be new restaurant jitters but I probably won\u2019t return.\nWe tried out this new restaurant in greenpoint and i'm giving a 5 star because I believe this restaurant has potential to grow! I love the interior and the vibe of this restaurant. Not sure if its usually loud but as it got later in the night it was hard to hear. The service was very fast and attentive. The cocktails were good I got the Kyuri which was refreshing (not in the pic) and the Hinagiku which is their take on margarita. I particularly was interested if the  yuzu kosho syrup would work well with this cocktail it's a 50/50 for me but i love the shiso salt used. The apps were good my favorite is the steak tartare! it's a must order! The Tempura sweet corn and garlic scape and bread was okay.

We asked medium rare for the doneness however i think it came out well done. Also if you eat the skirt steak as is, it's slightly salty but if you eat it together with the carrots and the sauce it brings out a different flavor profile! (i also love the carrots) The beef pie looked aesthetically pleasing. The first bite was really good and the beef was tender however it tasted slightly burned. We enjoyed our time everybody was very nice and shout out to our waitress Wahita she was kind and attentive.  I also would love to see a seasonal menu in the near future!\n\"First off, food was excellent! Menu is creative, meals were tasty, food came out quickly.\n\nThe stuff that could have been better: our server was nice but disorganized and very slow (it took 45 minutes to take our order!), lighting was too bright, decor was outdated (that banquette should have stayed in the 90s where it belongs) and way too bare, the space was so loud it was hard to hear each other.\n\nThis place has so much going for it, it just opened, and I feel like I went on an off night when they were understaffed \u2014 I\u2019ll definitely give it another shot.\"\n\"Fantastic service, beautiful spot, the cauliflower made me reconsider all my life decisions\n\nReally really good \ud83d\udc4c\"\nExcellent new restaurant in Greenpoint!

All of the dishes are very good, but there were 2 seriously incredible ones, the clams and the potatoes. I think the best potatoes of my life. Beef pie was sold out by 845 res, but thats just another reason to go back!\nIncredible experience, with delicious innovative cuisine.\nBeautiful Japanese- scandi designed restaurant in a great location. Food was flavorful! Steak tartare, cauliflower and bone marrow were favorites. Drinks were also delicious. Will definitely be back.\nGreat new restaurant with fresh and innovative flavors! The service was great, the ambiance relaxed, pretty, but not pretentious. I like the location too, have dinner then do a little waterfront stroll at the pier. Make sure to get the cauliflower and the beef pie. The milk bread, wasn\u2019t as soft as expected, but flavors and butter were good.\nWe had a lovely dinner here. The food was thoughtful and tasty. The service was great. The ambience was homey and unpretentious. Highly recommend!\n\"My wife and I were curious about this new restaurant opened yesterday  ( April 23 2023).
