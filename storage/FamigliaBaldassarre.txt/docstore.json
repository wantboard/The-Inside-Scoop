Have never been able to sit down but the seating area right outside is perfect on a nice day. Pasta is always fresh and made perfectly. They\\'92re tiramisu is delicious and I could finish the whole tram myself!!\n\\\n\"I mean, the pasta is definitely good, but it's not worth the wait. 5/5 for food, excluding wait. 2/5 including wait.\\\n\\\nThe pasta is fresh and delicious, sauces flavourful and refreshing, and a fair portion for a fairish price.\\\n\\\nThe bread is also solid.\\\n\\\nThat being said, showed up at 11:45, and walked out with the pasta at 13:15... This pasta is worth waiting 30 minutes for, max. I'd not recommend it unless there's a short line or wait.\\\n\\\nThere are also some fun things you can buy in retail, like an Nduja sauce.\"\n\\\n\"Best pasta in the city, was recommended by my work place, as I work in the industry.\\\nAlso just read the newest review before me.\\\nIdiots shouldn't have access to the internet is all I'm going to say.\\\nDon't believe bad reviews, some people have nothing better to do with their lives\"\n\\\n\"DON'T come here. it's the most overhyped trendy \"\"restaurant\"\" in the city. they brand themselves as really exclusive by only opening three times a week at the most inconvenient hours, having an absolutely d0gsh17 parking situation (the actual place is ugly as h3ll too), and taking SO LONG with their food that they have a lineup at all times (even tho their dishes are super simple). this faux lineup gives an impression of high demand.\\\n\\\nthey have like 4 tables only in this cramped little space, so unless you are truly insane then you will end up getting takeout, which is a whole mess in of itself because of how unorganized the space is.\\\n\\\nworst of all, the employees are RUDE and act like they have some sort of superiority complex, they treat you like they are doing you a favour by taking your order for their p4thetic food.\\\n\\\nthe actual pasta is nothing special, not the worst in the world but the placebo effect is very strong when it comes to the customer base. swap a famiglia baldassarre dish with an east side marios dish and i bet you won't be able to tell the difference. so please go anywhere else and don't fall prey to the propaganda\"\n\\\nIs this place worth the wait? Of course it is! I showed up at 11:52 on a Thursday as I saw on Instagram they were having Carbonara. I got to the front of the line around 12:55. Food came within 10 minutes of ordering.

RESPECT YOUR CLIENTS.\"\n\\\n\"The place that you know you will never get disappointed no matter what you order. Hate waiting in line for anything but for this place I will.\\\n\\\nGot there on Wed at 11:45am to wait in line outside. Once you order your food though, food comes out very quick. Got my food by 12:20pm and indoor tables were already full at that point. Think there were like only 4 tables. Could have waited longer to eat inside and have better food pics of their amazing food on pretty plates but chose to get my food in take out containers and sit at outside patio. Luckily it was sunny \\uc0\\u55356 \\u57118  outside.\\\n\\\nDaily menu was focaccia on the day I visited. I saw one customer left with a huge disappointment after they waited for 40 min, then found out that their was no pasta on the menu. Hey\\'85 just check their IG update before you come in.\\\n\\\nFoccacia Barese with tomatoes & olives with 16 mth old Prosciutto crudo di parma D.O.P ($16) made by Katia was fantastic. I stuffed prosciutto\\'92s in between pillowy fresh bread. I did not need anything else. Pure happiness in my mouth!!!\\\n\\\nHomemade burrata served with fried eggplant & lemony rapini($16) was really light, fresh and springy taste. Enjoyed it so much sitting out at the patio.\\\n\\\nTo finish you must order their $5 mini tiramisu. I could tell they used good quality coco powder, creamy mascarpone egg, good liquor, strong coffee. One of the best I have ever had!\\\n\\\nCannot wait to wait in line to get their pasta next time!\"\n\\\n\"Best fresh pasta I ever ate in Canada.\\\nPictures from April 27th, 2023 lunch menu\"\n\\\nExcellent meal!

Like they say, no extra cheese, no chili flakes, and none are needed. 2 menu items a day, none of them misses. Bring patience and heart. The line is long but worth it in the end. Staff is great, food is even better. 10/10 would recommend, but don't come, it's already too hard to get in ;)\n\\\n\"prepare for lineups, as this is a popular spot with due reason.\\\nwe visited Famiglia Baldassarre on their most popular day, Easter Friday. So when we showed up on Friday morning at 11, there were already people on line. They open at 12 so we were more than happy to wait, there\\'92s a couple of cafes right beside as well as down the street so we enjoyed some donuts and coffee while we waited. We got a seat indoors by 1, keep in mind they have very limited indoor seating so it was our choice to wait even longer. If you do take out, you can actually be on your way a lot faster.\\\nthe past was by far the best I have had in Toronto, without a doubt. And pricing is 100% reasonable when you compare it to other spots around the city. The quality and flavour of Famiglia Baldassarre is unquestionable. We ordered their beats, burrata+ prosciutto, two slice of bread (on the house) and two pastas for $60.\\\nI will most definitely come back.\"\n\\\nGet there early to line up for their lunch service.  It literally is just about the high quality food!\n\\\nArrived at 11:45am and had to wait approx 40 minutes for a seat to dine in. Staff were incredible. Made you feel so welcomed. We added the black truffle and it was a must!\n\\\n\"If you are looking for authentic REAL Italian food this is the place.\\\n\\\nThe food, service and people are all real and it\\'92s a great place to enjoy.\\\n\\\nAlways serving new items and being creative.\\\n\\\nIf you think east side Mario\\'92s is good then keep going there!\"\n\\\nBest fresh pasta place in Toronto. The lunch line-ups are worth it but you need to make sure you show up before 12 or else they sometimes sell out. Efficient service. Plenty of unique wines to pick up. We even got a lasagna to-go which was perfectly layered, fresh, and became the perfect, convenient dinner.\n\\\nExcellent fresh pasta.

That's all you really need to know. Besides getting there before 1230 if you plan on having lunch.\n\\\nDelish\n\\\nThe lunch was very disappointing. Very small portions, one hour wait (only 15 people in front of us), pasta was undercooked and the bread they served was burnt. The ragu was delicious but couldn't make up for the other downfalls. Forget the lunch, buy the pasta fresh and cook at home.\n\\\nDelicious Italian pasta with amazing sauces but the wait time was ridiculously long.\n\\\nGreat pasta made fresh and with quality ingredients, would go back more frequently but the lines are discouraging.\n\\\nThe pasta is unreal and to die for!

Seating is small but they really try to move fast and get food out.\\\n\\\nTomato sauce was savory and packed a ton of bright flavour. Butter parm sauce with the tagatelle fit perfectly. The pasta itself was a firm texture I dreamed about having for years. There's nothing quite like it around toronto. Fior de latte brine was on the saltier side, but that's a good thing. Dishes by themselves are good enough that they don't need anything else.\\\n\\\nIf you're looking for food done right, gotta add this place to your list.\"\n\\\nI came here today and the line up was about 3 hours long. I was dedicated so I waited in line hoping it was worth it. I tried the Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli & it was tasty & fresh. I gave it 3 stars because you literally get 7 average size raviolis for over $18 bucks. It was much more like an appetizer than a meal. In my my eyes it was not worth the price at all. I left still feeling hungry. The portion size should of been bigger for pasta nearly 20 bucks .\n\\\nWorth the trip and every penny spent. My girlfriend and I thought it was the best lasagna we had ever had the pleasure of tasting \\uc0\\u55357 \\u56843 \n\\\n20/10 the pasta here is like NO OTHER chefs kiss. Worth the wait and soooooo worth the hype. Customer service was so good \\uc0\\u55358 \\u56588 \\u55356 \\u57341 and so fast! And super welcoming. They explain the menu to you so thoroughly and they take your name, so when your orders ready they call you with a smile. Don\\'92t think I\\'92ll be eating other local pastas anymore after this.I enjoyed it definitely going back next week.\n\\\nOne of the best Italian food that you can find in Toronto.. these guys are only open from 12 to 2 fornlunch..its totaly worth doing the visit during the lunch.. we are so glad to find this spot during the covid time. thier pastas are the best in Canada..  Pastas are so fresh, you can feel that... they put so much thought into their dishes.. service is absolute top notch.. it's the lunch that we always look forward\n\\\nWaited 2 hours but so worth it. Best and freshest pasta I've ever had. Definitely going back when the menu rotates to try more\n\\\n\"(Translated by Google) A place to enjoy in the summer, the wait is 20-30 minutes, they inform you if you will get lunch, the choice is two pastas with butter or tomato.

They have absolutely earned their reputation as one of the best pasta-makers in the city. Their hours are limited, so if you don't come early then you may need to wait in a long line (and I believe that they often sell out).\n\\\nSome of the best fresh pasta we have ever had!

Can't go back soon enough!\n\\\nFood was exceptional. Full of flavour and very authentic Italian. Tried both pasta's they had that day and the Fior Di Latte and Crudo di Parma were to die for. Do not leave without trying their Tiramisu! We went knowing there would be a line and expecting to wait.

Ho assaporato i sapori di una volta, il vero rag\\'f9 napoletano.\"\n\\\nWonderful ravioli and a flavoursome lasagna. A bit pricey but worth it and a  filling meal\n\\\nI can only imagine their success being so big because they are probably the only place in town making fresh pasta. The waiting is insane for pasta that cooks in 3-5 minutes and have the sauces ready (1:40 from the time we arrived til we got our food on a Friday - they day they have the most basic menu). It got me thinking how they can be so inefficient doing such basic dishes. It tastes good, fresh ingredients, the Italian way. But customer service and experience could be improved so much! There\\'92s not even a washroom available for customers. Frankly, only in a city where there\\'92s no competition I can see this being a success. Any other big city they would lose customers making them wait for that long for tagliatelle al ragu e ravioli al burro e salvia. My advice: if you really want to try, just pick up the frozen pasta and cook at your place.\n\\\nWell worth the wait! Excellent service and amazing food!\n\\\nGreat pastas made with fresh, seasonal ingredients. Their menu rotates so there\\'92s always something new to try! Come early or be prepared to wait in line for awhile. They sometimes sell out so it\\'92s in your best interest to arrive before the lunch rush.\n\\\nDelicious lunch!  Need the recipe for the chickpea salad.\n\\\nI\\'92d come here every day if I could. The only spot in Toronto where the pasta actually reminds me of being back in Italy.\n\\\nIt was good. But not worth the lineup. Better off taking their sauce and pasta home to eat.\n\\\nTheir pastas are amazing. Definitely worth the wait to try at least once. Head there early if you want to beat the lunch rush from 12-2\n\\\nBEST PASTA in Toronto. Expect a lineup if you show up on a nice day for the lunch counter - but it's worth the wait.
