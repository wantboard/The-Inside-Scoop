This 2 michelin star restaurant was solid. Nothing surprised me but it hit my comfort spot. Went there for lunch which was a 10 course tasting menu and it was comfortably enough. Extremely satisfied. Everything stood out for me, but the langoustine and the venison was a chef\u2019s kiss. It was cooked absolutely to perfection. I personally admired the sauces of each course the most, the liquid texture and flavor was different and incredible. It was mind blowing.\nThe staff were super delicate. I was feeling the AC wind hitting straight to my head and they immediately resolved this problem. The environment is towards the dark side but for lunch because of the natural sun light it was very comfortable. My only two complaint would be the menu handed out and the fact that I was having a celebration. I expected something complimentary since I was celebrating an occasion, but we didn\u2019t receive anything. Moreover, at the end we get to have the menu, and unfortunately it was handed out just a folded piece of paper; professionally I would prefer it in an envelope or something covering the piece of paper or even folding it into a book. They could take a note on that.\nOverall, delicious and outstanding. I will go back to try their winter tasting menu.\"\nAska and the caring staff are stunning! They left us feeling full and inspired with their exceptional service and food bursting with flavour. I would highly recommend this super cool and sleek spot.\nPerfect as always\nEverything was perfect!\nNever disappointed. Memorable menu with solid wine choices.\nGreat place, especially if you like dishes with caviar and truffle. The wine pairing is also very good and worth the experience.\n\"There is dining, there is fine dining, and then there is Aska\u2026mind blowing experience of taste, flavors and scents. Tastefully and visually stunning.\nI definitely recommend it.\nAlso the staff was super professional, polite and friendly.\nBeautiful place. Looking forward to  visit again when in NYC.\"\nI can\u2019t even tell you how good this place is - you should try for yourself! A unique Scandinavian experience with fresh and delicious dishes and impeccable service. Wine pairings and presentations are amazing too. Chef Fredrik personally welcomes guests (think \u201cEmily in Paris\u201d, haha), and the the team makes you feel special during the whole time!\u2728Definitely worth the money.\nThe most surreal dining experience I've ever had. The food was amazing and it may have been the best meal of my life.\n\"1. I personally was disappointed at the desserts. If this restaurant has a pastry chef (do they?), I think that person will need to work harder \u2014 even if I\u2019m not comparing it to EMP\u2019s desserts.\n2. They served the dishes for us (specifically) too slowly maybe because we were served right after the private room (which probably had 5-7 ppl). We sat down at 8:00pm (the time we reserved) and finished at around 11:15pm. Unfortunately, I had to say it was an unpleasant experience for us because we waited too long between a few dishes \u2014 the wait time between dishes varied significantly. For other tables later than us, we could tell that they sped up (and sadly, they pretended we didn\u2019t notice that \u2014 no apologies at all :) When they introduced dishes to me, the way they spoke made me feel like they had a long day. We\u2019ve been to a few Michelin-starred restaurants \u2014 needless to say 3 stars like EMP, just among 2 stars, compared to the way Atomix served dishes (which is smart and pleasant), the way this restaurant served dishes is disappointing. If you clearly don\u2019t have the ability to serve like a 3 stars, just use the way Atomix uses. The thing you want least is to waste your client\u2019s time.

Fun wine list too!\n\"Went here with my wife in Dec 2022 for a few celebratory reasons (promotion/board certified). By far in terms of taste, Aska is not afraid to smash extremely BOLD flavors together to create a crashing wave of flavored within one's palate. Truly this displays the chef Fredrik's exemplary culinary art beyond securing quality ingredient sources.\n\nThe service was excellent! I asked where the restroom was located which they could have simply pointed me to the directions and I'd be fine, but they waiter stopped what they were doing and walked me to the location. My dining experience is limited, but one thing I did notice was each and every waiter did this  at Aska, when they picked up the dishes, they gripped the plates using the thenar of their palms, there fingers were never extended beyond the palm. I think this is unique and I guess this is a gesture to show their fingers will never touch the areas where food might be placed.\n\nFor the food, we did not get the wine pairing option. There were about 12 courses, each and everyone was amazing in its own. Many of them were likely described from other posts, so I'll only focus on a few that stood out especially amongst the course. The Bladderwrack, Scallop, Lobster, Langoustine, and Hake.\n\nBladderwrack is a type of seagrape/algae, it was presented as a dried up version of this plant that's packed with the brininess of the sea...but it appears there were locations along the plant that weren't that briney, alternating nodes of blue mussel emulsion brings a depth of a different type of the sea flavor smooth/slight creamy, nutty and BOLD. The crispy texture of the bladderwrack mix with the muscle emulsion literally punches each other within my mouth as if they're each trying to be the apex flavor back and forth. This represents the essence of nature itself, animals vs plants fighting for the seat of the ocean throne that leaves a torrent of flavor waves crashing, then subsiding as the waves recede leaving the aftermath of a devastating battle on my palate.\n\nSeveral courses later, the Scallop. Like most food, the scallops quality is top notch, thinly sliced wrapped around a thin cylinder of turnip to increase the surface area in order to soak up the jus, but what stood out more was the Scallop Jus that accompanied the dish. Meticulous thoughts went into utilizing every part of the animal to heighten it's flavor. The jus was crisp and clear with extreme depth of flavor of the mollusk, but this depth was a huge contrast from the previous dishes in terms of how it danced on the palate. This dish was more like the \"\"calmness within the eye of the storm\"\". In the cold weather of NYC December, the warmth and serene jus of scallop warms ones soul and relaxes ones mind. It's as if I'm being caudle by the mother of pearls within a giant clam in the deepest part of the ocean, undisturbed by even the storm that's brewing.\n\nThe Lobster was amazing! It redefines the term \"\"surf and turf\"\". The lobster It was perfectly cooked, soft, juicy", "doc_id": "0f4ddba3-ee33-4209-9636-8ae88774306d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "91224f38c20d6e158349a732e12ce268c86f0fd43b5bb0df0be1d6b84649bfc6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3351, "end": 7119}, "relationships": {"1": "2638507c-e351-4031-8a59-8ee136849467", "2": "60398f0e-516d-40a2-b9a2-a9927955df52", "3": "d517c765-965e-4821-95c5-fe9678eeb955"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d517c765-965e-4821-95c5-fe9678eeb955": {"__data__": {"text": "went into utilizing every part of the animal to heighten it's flavor.

It redefines the term \"\"surf and turf\"\". The lobster It was perfectly cooked, soft, juicy in its natural sweetness, hint of smokey flavor, on the sides were caviar packed with briney and nutty aftertaste. Black truffle brings a new bold flavor of earthy and nutty flavor to top it off with foam from chanterelle mushroom. Again, BOLD flavors where I envision the funguses trying to decompose and absorb the flavors of the lobster and in turn, the lobster and caviar struggling to survive by fighting back using their last ditch effort to claim as the apex flavor.\n\nLangoustine perfectly cooked, redgoose berry jam had light notes of sweet and tangy, mix it all up with the caramelized shell-foam of the creature, using every part of the animal to heighten it's essence\n\nLast is the Hake fish, caviar from Kaluga and roe from trout, bathed in a mixture of jus that taste nutty, smokey, slight hint of acid, with savory aftertaste. The hake texture was crisp and firm, similar to how a perfectly cooked crab.\n\nFredrick was not shy at all when playing with BOLD flavors that created these amazing masterpiece. I really hope he and his amazing staff receives a 3 star soon.\"\nBetter than s3x.\nPretentious staff. Trent was the rudest waiter I\u2019ve ever experienced in a gourmet restaurant\nPhenomenal\nAmazing food, great wine, beautiful atmosphere\n\"Wonderful food\nToo much fish\nThey forgot the cake with candle for my birthday while some other tables got it.\"\nHands down, this is one of the best spot for starvation after a 3-hour experience. The layout of the restaurant was meticulously detailed. Every seat was positioned facing the open kitchen. The outdoor terrace is an adorable addition to the main dining room. Moving on to the foods, we were enthralled by creativity in each item, but the portion was miserable. I fully appreciate the concept of leaving the audience wanting more after each dish. However, me and my friends were feeling increasingly hungry after each bite. At the end, we asked the manager for additional supplements, which we were told that they don\u2019t carry extra materials in the kitchen that they could improvise. So, i cooked my friends lobster and short ribs when we got home.\nFrom start to finish both the food and staff at Aska are top notch. This is a restaurant that definitely lives up to its reputation. Currently a 2 star Michelin restaurant, I will not be surprised if it reaches 3 star in the near future. The staff is very attentive  the food is delicious and the sommelier Missy seems to have a knack for finding uniquely delicious pairings. I Highly recommend.\nA huge thank you to Kenna for helping fit me in on such short notice! It was an incredible meal, with flawless service.

I\u2019ve been wanting to go here for quite some time, and it totally lived up to its 2 Michelin stars. The tasting menu is 12 courses, but each course is small, so it\u2019s manageable. You\u2019ll leave feeling satisfied but not overly full. The tasting menu changes seasonally. We went at the end of August, so the menu was all seafood minus one dish.\n\nThere a couple of things I really liked about Aska that made it unique from other Michelin restaurants. A lot of Michelin restaurants can feel stuffy and a bit pretentious. Aska does not. The restaurant is located in Williamsburg, and the service was excellent, but still friendly and down to earth. We particularly liked the Somm. She was excellent and clearly loved her job. The restaurant is very minimal, and they only serve 8-10 tables at a time. The chefs serve each dish which is unique, and it created an  intimate and special atmosphere. We really enjoyed our experience, and would love to come back in a different season and see how they innovate on their menu. They definitely deserve 3 stars, and I\u2019m hoping they get their 3rd star soon! Congrats to the Chef and the excellent team at Aska!\"\nOne star for using a reservation system that has a three in the iOS App Store. I am now twice been taught to believe that I had successfully booked a reservation. Both times I didn\u2019t read into not getting a confirmation. Now a missed anniversary dinner.\n\"Aska delivers again!  This is my second time dining at Aska and the chefs do not disappoint.  All the dishes were delicious and visually appealing, and the elements blend together well for the entire dish.  The first time we went, the langoustine was absolutely amazing.  This time, the lobster was equally amazing (langoustine was a bit too sweet), but the tenderness and the flakiness of the hake absolutely took the prize.\nThe staff were so lovely and courteous and made us feel extremely welcome.  And we loved the sommelier!  She provided a lot of information about the wines and made sure we loved our wines.\nI would dine here again and look forward to the next time I can visit Aska.\"\nAmazing dinner !\nI can\u2019t even put into words how amazing this dining experience was.

The dishes were delicious and creative, design is modern yet cozy, atmosphere is elegant but also nice & \u201ehuman\u201d.\nBut!\nFirst of all - for the first time in my life I\u2019ve been hungry after tasting menu. It\u2019s not a standard in fine dining restaurants and spending 1000 USD per 2 people. And as I read other reviews - it\u2019s not new news for the restaurant, they could address this problem.\nSecondly - the dishes were ok when it comes to flavor notes, but very repetitive in form. We laughed after reading one of the other reviews \u201eDifferent types of fish in various sauce types\u201d - to the point. I expected much more after 2 Michelin Stars in NYC, but it was my weakest Michelin experience ever.\nLast but not least - wines were really not outstanding. Maybe it\u2019s US problem, but none of the wines enriched the paired dishes. They were correct, but not worth remembering at all.\"\nOverall a good experience and good food. Would recommend.\n\"I am a fan of Chef Fredrik Berselius after reading an article about how he brings his love of nature through Aska. It was our first try of Scandinavian cuisine in fine dining and our experience was amazingly impressive.\n\nThe decor is modern and elegant in minimalist style with cozy ambiance. Reservation is a must and it\u2019s not that difficult to get a table even for weekend dinner. We did a reservation a week ahead for a Friday early dinner at 5:30pm.\n\nThey confirmed our food restrictions in details a day before our visit. There was a total of 14 courses and they would provide the menu of what they serve at the end of the meal. The portion was decent for us to feel comfortably full, but maybe not enough for some people.\n\nMost of the ingredients were seafood and cooked perfectly with delicate texture. Our favorites were the Langoustine, which was tender and puffy Berries. The sauce made with caramelized shell & gooseberry for langoustine was appetizing and flavorful.\n\nMy husband loved and enjoyed their artsy plating so much. Not only our taste buds, but also sense of sight felt satisfied, so we would highly recommend people who need to celebrate for special occasions to give them a try.\"\nBeautiful restaurant\nExcellent presentation and quality of food. But the portions in the tasting menu are too small so you come out hungry after paying almost $500 per person.\nAmazing experience!\nSimply sublime. Textures and flavors I didn't know existed. Mostly exceptionall service. Very creative wine pairings.  A true \"experience.\"\nDelicious food and great experience. Fantastic wine pairings, attentive service, relaxed atmosphere.\n\"(Translated by Google) We celebrated my birthday in this Scandinavian restaurant.

Well thought out but everything tastes fishy and fermented. I left still hungry after spending $330 per person\nTasteing menu has 12 different bite size dishes, mostly seafood. Kind of expensive and if you have a normal appetite, you will not feel full afterward.\nBest meal I\u2019ve ever had\nAmazing place where creativity has no limit. Chef Frederick is amazing,  not only talented but friendly and a pleasure to be around. The food, attention to details, nothing is missing from the dining experience at Aska. Maybe only the 3rd Michelin star which he fully deserves in my humble opinion.

Enjoyed the first dish (on kelp) and ice cream dessert less than other courses. Food arrived at a comfortable pace; usually a few minutes between each of 14 courses and about a half-dozen paired drinks. As aesthetic as it was delicious, to the extent that, for a few courses, it seemed premature for the servers to immediately cover the artpiece with sauce/etc. Maybe a solution is to ask the customer whether they'd want to pour it themselves. Nonetheless, impeccable coordinated service. Environment and scenery feel NYC-esque (more condensed and low-key than one may expect). Overall an impressive, unique, unforgettable meal. Aska deserves its stars: both Michelins and the 5 I give it.\nUniqe dining experience, Scandinavian flavored, but highly personal\n\"Attended the Michelin Guide X Capital One: Summer Dinner Series and it was an incredible experience at Aska.

The space reflects the food - minimal with poignant tastes. The 14-course format wasn\u2019t rushed but I was left wanting more after each course. I\u2019m privy to small and articulated dishes but Aska could refine the portion sizes. There were a few service hiccups along the way, but nothing that ruined the overall experience. Sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable.\nAbsolutely amazing experience. Went for lunch and ordered the juice pairings. Very unique juice compositions that would be served as they paired with the dishes. The food was delicious and I was able to try some ingredients I don't normally see.This restaurant has an eye for detail, down to the placement of every flower on the plate, the cloth on the table and even the bathroom. I loved hearing the chefs describe their creations and I loved learning the story behind the food set in front of me. I felt very inspired by my experience here!\nA 3.5 hour journey that takes you through Scandinavia with a wonderful wait staff and knowledgeable chefs. You walk into a black building with no sign. This place does not need a flashy sign because it earns your respect with its quality. The staff is so attentive without hovering. They know what you want before you know it. They also all smell great. I know that's a bit strange to comment on, but it's a detail they didn't forget. They make sure the air that goes past you as they walk by smells right and doesn't throw you off the dish. We went through 14 dishes and all were timed beautifully. The wine pairing was like a dance. Its goal was always to balance the flavors of the dishes. They refill your wine glass if you finish it early with just enough to last you until the next wine and dish pair. If you're looking for a 2 Michelin star that feels like a 3 Michelin star, this is it.\nIncredible Scandinavian cuisine nestled under the Williamsburg bridge. Meticulously crafted dishes, top notch ingredients, scandi minimalistic interior, totally worth the splurge.\nAMAZING! Multidimensional meals with incredible service.\nExcellent lunch pre fix menu. This restaurant stands out in the way that Jungsik, in NY, and Atica, in Australia, have stood out. The attention to detail was apparent and the kitchen executed all of the dishes perfectly. I can\u2019t wait to return and experience the dinner menu.\nGreat experience, flawless service, good modernization of classic Scandinavian flavors.\nWhile this place obviously doesn't need more recognition, it truly deserves acknowledgement. The tasting menu is complex, creative, and full of brilliance. The wine pairings I had were excellent executed. The service was attentive and warm.

We waited up to 30 minutes in between courses. As mentioned in other reviews portions are scant... Though I was expecting that we would be satisfied after the meal given it has 2 Michelin stars. Shortly after the meal, my Mother and I got very sick in a way that I should leave out the details. I contacted the restaurant to inform them and they wanted nothing to do with it. In both replies from Kevin, I was told that it was something else that my Mother and I ate, up to 48 hours ago. It is no coincidence that we both had the same dietary restrictions and ended up sick after this meal (my Father was also with us did not get sick, he does not have dietary restrictions and did not get served the same menu.) My Mother and I hadn't seen each other in weeks until this meal, and therefore something we both ate made us sick. This is not how good management would handle this situation.\n\nOther points to mention... The menu they gave us to take home was almost completely different from the actual menu any of us ate. The juice pairing was interesting, though you would think that with each course you would be served a different pairing, surprisingly it was not the case. I could probably go on, but no bother, as I won't be returning.\"\n\"Service was great, as would be expected for a Michelin star restaurant. Ambience was nice too. Food was presented well, but taste was a bit inconsistent - some were good, others were bland and not flavorful.\n\nTwo issues stood out for us: 1) Our reservation had to be rescheduled due to indoor dining shutdown during winter holidays, but it was supposed to be a special occasion (birthday) dinner regardless. There was no acknowledgment of that throughout the entire experience. 2) We left hungry, which is extremely rare for us after a tasting menu.\"\n\"Two months into the second Covid reopening, and Aska has obviously hit the ground running.  For the smaller lunch menu, I was treated to three hours of excellent atmosphere, service and, of course, food.\n\nWhile I've only been to maybe a half-dozen Michelin restaurants in Scandinavian countries, the otherwise highly enjoyable menu presented here in Williamsburg seemed a lot more of an \"\"inspired-by\"\" than \"\"authentic-recipe-of,\"\" and somewhat altered my expectations.\n\nThat aside, I truly enjoyed the razor clam/ cucumber r\u00e9duction amuse bouche and the celeriac/ truffle/ dried venison that accompanied the excellent roast venison, and of course, the bedstraw ice cream/ meadowsweet caramel.\n\nI must return very soon.\n\n2021 04 10.

The space itself it also amazing; sleek and minimal, you can really watch the show unfold in front of you as dish after dish comes at you. The one thing I truly love about this place is that the nordic influence is not very common in the NYC food scene, especially at this level. A must visit, especially for special occasions.\nEverything about this whole experience was amazing. When greeted at the door, our temperature was taken and our coats were hung for us. We were given both sanitizer and hot towels to clean our hands. From the first course to the last one, was such a pleasant experience. Everything was delicious. The chef and the team were amazing at explaining each dish and the lovely wines. The bathroom was also so clean and had a cool aesthetic. The ambiance of the entire restaurant was amazing.

And they also offered excellent service.\n\"An incredible meal with service kept at a very high level.\n\nIf the menu included an additional course, I'm sure few would complain - it's a bit light for the length of time.\n\nWine pairings are distinctive and smart. The juice or combo pairing is pretty good, but honestly, don't waste your time. Our tablemates preferred the wine pairing in each course over the juice.\n\nThey do pour more wine when your glass is low, though it would be more pleasant to sit with a reasonable pour for 2 courses instead. Of the service, wine pouring was without a doubt their weakest moments - perhaps by design. My partner didn't feel the least bit inebriated.\n\nPlating was beautiful. It's my own agenda, but I felt the food could play with perceptions and expectations more. I prefer to be surprised, perhaps offended - and this meal was very gentle, polite. Don't let bladderwrack throw you off - to those that are not so interested in experiencing entirely new things, this is an immaculate experience that is only slightly different from the norm.\n\nMusic should reflect the vision of the chef - if the songs we heard are it, I'm a bit surprised. I could imagine myself hearing them at a casual restaurant, and would prefer to be transported a bit more into a different headspace. The scent in the bathroom is a lovely fir tree, and the soap is neutral.\n\nAska is very good compared to other meals I've had in New York, which I feel has an awful lot of tradition without substance plaguing it's top restaurants. Aska is ritual and reason, instead. Nothing felt superfluous. It was lovely.\"\n\"One of the world's must visit food labs!\nDecor and lighting taken from a Rembrandt painting scene, plates take you to a yet to be found out of space planet.\nDont expect to like all flavors, just enjoy the privilege to experience something truly unique.\"\nTo sum up my experience at aska in one word, I would go with inspired. The Chef is clearly at the top of his game and is striving to push himself to the absolute pinnacle of his abilities.  Interestingly, you can clearly see the Chef's influence everywhere you look and in everything you experience from arriving at the restaurant to departing. Arriving is like discovering a hidden gem tucked away in Brooklyn just across and down and to the left of the Brooklyn Bridge when approaching from Manhattan, the location is stunning and absolutely perfect, it is clear immediately that is no accident.

We had the chance to meet the chef briefly, as expected, almost a bit introverted, likely thinking about how to infuse magic into his next creation, likely a genius, certainly an impressive, humble, yet confident person, exudes passion. The food, my review is already too long but oh my, to say I was exasperated with delight would be an understatement to the extreme. The food, for lack of a better term, was perfect.

The space is absolutely gorgeous and the perfect size for a place like this. All the dishes are exquisite and have just the right amount of flavor. I left very satisfied. What an enjoyable experience. I'd visit again.\nAmazing food if you are willing to try new flavour and pay high prices. All of the food is prepared with care and an unbelievable attention to detail that contributes to every step being just perfectly right.\nRun by Chef Fredrik Berselius, Aska is offering Scandinavian nordic cuisine of high quality and fresh ingredients. The presentation is amazing. However, it is not one of the places where form takes over substance. Each dish was loaded with intense flavour that satisfies souls and eye. Decor is simple yet chic as you would expect in an Scandinavian ambiance. Service was competent, charming and attentive.\nSome very good dishes but the meal overall lacked a cohesive direction. I wish they had delved more into the dishes and some seemed to be thrown into the tasting. For $300+ a person, there are many other restaurants that are not only better tasting but also much more special.\nGreat, innovative food. Very tasty, good atmosphere.
