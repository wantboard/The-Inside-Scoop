Owned by renowned head chef Missy Robbins, never before have I dined at an establishment that had a complete mastery of the application of salt like I experienced at Lilia. That said, the word is spreading quickly around Lilia which means you need to book a reservation at least 30 days in advanced to get a table. Slight buzz kill but it is totally worth the wait.\nAs we dive into the menu, the Cacio E Pepe fritters are my favorite option to begin your meal, the crisp exterior paired with the gooey cheesy center is divine.\nAs previously emphasized, Lilia has built a reputation for exceptionally crafted pastas, you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice if you don\u2019t order one during your visit. I personally enjoy the mafaldini with pink peppercorn and pecorino or the fettuccini with spicy lamb sausage. Both are staples on the menu and are frequent eye catches on IG. Pro tip, keep an eye out for any seasonal pastas, I recently tried the ricotta gnocchi with broccoli pesto and it was heavenly; made a strong case for my all time favorite pasta entree. Overall, the pasta dishes are simply perfection.\nIf you\u2019ve managed to leave room for desert, which I suggest you do, ask your server for \u201cthe Italian Job\u201d. It\u2019s an interesting take on soft serve ice cream with sweet, salty and savory flavors intertwined that bombard your tastebuds seamlessly. It\u2019s amazing.\nLilia is great for a special date night or when your trying to show off your knowledge of NYC must eats. You\u2019ll be reminiscing of your Lilia experience long after you\u2019ve digested this amazing meal.\"\nFood is amazing. Restaurant can be overcrowded and loud.\nOver-rated.  The famed cacio e pepe frizelle was ok.  The grilled clams were really chewy and over spiced.  The pasta was good.  But the grilled lamb leg steak was tough, over done and just not very appetizing.  Service was good.  Ambience also good.  Not worth the hype or the prices.\nNice restaurant\n\"quite disappointing coming back here after a while. service was extremely overbearing, pushing us to drink more and more, order every upsell and get way too much to eat. set us off to a terrible start.\n\nthe starters in all honestly were very basic and not worth the elongated wait or the price. dish had 35-40 minutes between the one before it. flavours did not extend beyond salt, pepper and red pepper. kind of ridiculous if you ask me.\n\npastas were ok. not misi level and not worth it.\n\nwe left without bothering for the yummy ice cream at the end. we\u2019d been there for two hours and were consistently let down already.\n\ndefinitely not bothered in coming back for such an expensive, long, and unimpressive meal. hype has gotten to their head a little\u2026\"\nfresh, simple, delicious, consistent. our favorite restaurant year after year.\n\"Loved it. We had the grilled prawns as a starter, they were great but very hard to peel. Then we have the agnolotti and the gnochi. Agnolotti were amazing, the taste of the pasta was something new and delicious.\nThe gnochi, I loved that they were souffle, but the pesto was just ok- they did a different turn and instead of pine nuts do it with pistachio.\nService was great and the vibe is nice.

Highly recommend.\nThe foccacia was the best I've ever had\nI was lucky enough to get a last minute reservation here on the last day of our vacation. We started with the fresh mozzarella on sourdough. The cheese had the most divine texture, it was so soft and went so nice with the crusty bread. The oven baked shrimp were massive and so flavourful. Slightly messy to eat but they gave you a wet towel to clean your hands after. I had heard that Lilia served the best pasta in the city. I had their ravioli, which I found disappointing. They were so small with a minuscule amount of filling. I also wish there was more of a sauce instead of just butter. We had their soft serve ice cream for dessert. The chocolate was great but the vanilla was watery, they did take that off of our bill. Great service and atmosphere.\nThey need to improve line organization. Arriving at 3:45 is not guarantee of siting and you can wait in line for 50 minutes before they let you know\nbagna cauda and agnolotti was divine.\nSadly, not a friendly environment. I walked in and was treated poorly. I was asked to sit in the back, next to the restroom area? I moved and asked if I could be seated at the bar, this too was an issue apparently. They had to reconfirm if the bar seats were available and not booked? It\u2019s the BAR! Then, you have to share a space one inch away from the others sitting at the bar. Definitely, will not return, I admire a place where they value their customers as we are their first priority. With-out us there is no them! Keep that in-mind next time you want to disregard your customers.\n\"Quick tips: Only go for the pasta dishes. The patio seating is nice but it's not a patio, it's outdoor seating close to the street. And they don't mention it in advance, but your table is timed for 2 hours.\n\nDetailed review:\nThere are several issues with Lilia. If you are an avid foodie, you can spot Missi Robbins' culinary intelligence in how the dishes are built, but Lilia's food and service are both inconsistent, and the difficulty of getting a reservation does not justify the experience whatsoever. We split 2 starters, 1 salad, and 3 pasta dishes between the two of us.\n\nThe good: some dishes (mostly pastas) are unique, interesting and intelligent. Our server was also very kind, attentive, and made great suggestions, even thinking outside the box - very well appreciated. And prices are very fair.\n\nThe bad: execution and management.\n\nWith the exception of 2 pasta dishes, it was like the cooks didn't get what Robbins was trying to do. First, the coarsely shredded cheese is heavily topping every dish and as a result is overshadowing the nuanced herbs, citrus, sauces and even the star of the dishes such as the artichoke that completely disappeared. What a shame. Second, the artichoke dish's best part was the pool of broth it was served with - without spoon, so we couldn't eat it. Third, the salad had a few drops too many of otherwise a good vinegar. Couldn't finish it.\n\nNext, leaves were not fresh! That was pretty shocking to see. Yellow mint leaf topping the artichoke, black edges on", "doc_id": "509a01d0-80b6-4294-adfe-440bc491963e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ed50685868154b96316ebe75d998ad7c4ccdd1368e3082d5dca5cda352aa422c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3039, "end": 6785}, "relationships": {"1": "bdbfafcb-9327-4033-9fa5-8efea359510d", "2": "f3751e6b-0787-4cb0-92f0-8cb25a368434", "3": "f7a790cb-7d46-4460-a923-2334b143fb92"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7a790cb-7d46-4460-a923-2334b143fb92": {"__data__": {"text": "bad: execution and management.\n\nWith the exception of 2 pasta dishes, it was like the cooks didn't get what Robbins was trying to do.

Third, the salad had a few drops too many of otherwise a good vinegar. Couldn't finish it.\n\nNext, leaves were not fresh! That was pretty shocking to see. Yellow mint leaf topping the artichoke, black edges on lettuce leaves in the salad.\n\nLastly -- their ice cream was salty, and it wasn't mentioned in the menu at all. Completely throws off the experience when you want to finish with something sweet or at least neutral. Add a little salt in ice cream for good measure, but theirs was fighting with the sugar over the spotlight.\n\nWhat saved the night were two pasta dishes, so intelligent and minimalistic and with terrific ingredients (the pink peppercorn pasta and the cheese-filled pasta with saffron), one of which was served to us cold and we kept thinking \"\"ah, it would have been amazing had it been warm\"\".\n\nWhich get me to the last negative: management. In addition to the cold pasta, they completely forgot to hand back to us our leftovers, worth about $90. And why did we leave without them? Because they kicked us out of the table so we were pressured to quickly finish the desert (after already paying the bill). And why did they kick us out? We had a reservation for 5:45. We were running late so we called them. No answer. Called them again. No answer. As we got off the Uber at 6:03, I get a text that they cancelled our reservation because they keep tables for 15 minutes (without a warning about that when they texted me in the morning the confirm reservation). Two minutes later, at 6:05, we go in and the hostess says they sent us the cancellation text, but she \"\"thinks she can still give us the table\"\" - only that we have to leave by 7:30. (You think you can still give us our table that you cancelled literally 120 seconds ago? Ok..) Later that night, at 7:30, our waiter said the next reservation is at 7:45, so a quick math tells you that our 5:45 table was reserved for 2 hours. Meaning, they only give you 2 hours to eat but they never warn you about it. You want to limit us to 2 hours? Fine that's your business and I respect your choices - but you have to tell your guests that.\n\nI didn't argue with anyone over this because that would just ruin the experience, but the management should know about this and correct for future guests. Other reviews have complained about that too.\n\nIn retrospect, we've been to Missi as well and that place imparted the same feeling of rushing us through the meal, like an assembly line.\"\nSolid pasta, not worth the hype or dealing with the absolutely abysmal service. Nothing gets to you. Forget \u201con time.\u201d The host (not server, who was friendly but slow) was rude from the start and continued to give us attitude despite us having waited over 40 mins for the cheque.

Clearly feeling pressured, we said we were ready to order appetizers and WE asked if we had to place the entire order at once. Our waitress said yes. So fine, we do. The food was good.\n\nAs we are eating our last entree, around 8 pm, our waitress tells us they need to move us for the dessert portion of the meal. And that it needs to happen right now. We look at each other like, \u201cok well this is bizarre\u201d but we assumed they\u2019d just move us to another table, so weird but no big deal yet.\n\nThey take us through the restaurant to the small adjoining coffee shop that is not part of the main restaurant area where they tell us we can finish our meal at two barstools - for the three of us. Two metallic barstools with no back where the three of us were supposed to magically sit. We were carrying our drinks, too, and the counter space is tiny - meant for coffee, not finishing a meal for three.\n\nWe were shocked and immediately felt insulted. My father asked to speak to the manager. She could not have been MORE bothered or LESS apologetic. She begrudgingly asked us what they could do to make it right - we told her we wanted her to know how appalled we were by where we\u2019d been placed to finish our meal and we wanted them to have the opportunity to make it right by doing what they thought was fair. She returned and said she took the drinks off that WERE NOT wine - so two beers and a couple cocktails. She took $90 off our $650+ bill.\n\nIt became abundantly clear at that point, if it hadn\u2019t been already, that she was not interested in rectifying what had ruined our meal in any meaningful way. We told her we were disappointed - she had the opportunity to make it right and hadn\u2019t - and she again was not the least bit apologetic.\n\nSo, to be clear, the restaurant erred first by requiring that we place our entire order at the outset of the meal but then not spacing things out correctly so we had time to finish our entire meal at our table, and then making us move to an area separate from the main restaurant while we were still eating, with drinks in hand, to a less nice coffee area where the three of us were expected to sit at two uncomfortable barstools. They then erred the second time when the manager showed no remorse for the inconvenience and embarrassing and disrespectful treatment, and acted without remorse when given the opportunity to fix it.\n\nMy father spoke with the general manager, Janette Delfin, a couple days later. She was, according to him, profusely apologetic - said we had been mistreated in every way and that she would be sending us a gift card. But one thing concerned me - he said she told him the restaurant should have communicated to us how long we had for dinner. But this made no sense - even if they had done that, they were responsible for ensuring we had sufficient time to eat everything we ordered.

Innovative, fresh & absolutely delicious.\n\"We came on Saturday night, it was fair weather outside and we sat on the sidewalk. The sidewalk tables are fine, they are metal. We were seated quickly.\n\nWe got mozzarella bread, grilled octopus, agnolotti, and grilled lamb steak. All of the food was balanced, flavorful, and well presented. We were immediately encouraged to get two appetizers after we said we would not be getting drinks. Because, they said, the portions were small. We were full halfway through our entrees. The lamb steak was humongous.\n\nThe main let down of the experience was the service. We didn\u2019t feel taken care of. For the first time in my dining out experience, save for fast food, I was not asked how I wanted my meat cooked.\n\nNevertheless, an enjoyable meal.\"\nSadly I wasn't able to try the food because I was mistreated by the staff. I arrived 15 minutes before the 4PM opening and was 6th in line. Everyone before me had no reservation and got seated immediately. When it was my turn I was told there was only seating at the bar, it would be a 15 minute wait for the kitchen to finish preping and to wait in the small caf\u00e9 in the back. I was the only POC in the line and feel like I was told to wait in the back because of that. After waiting for 5 minutes in the caf\u00e9 and realizing the people behind me waiting, who aslo did not have a reservation, got seated I got up and left because I don't think I deserved that treatment.\n\"This review is about the dining experience as opposed to the food.

Service was just as good. The sheep\u2019s milk agnolotti are my fav. Highly recommend!\nAbsolutely stunning restaurant. Lilia has mouth watering food served by a super kind, helpful and attentive wait staff\nEverything is restaurant is gold! From appetizers, pasta and dessert! The service is also topnotch! No wonder people really vouch for this place.\n\"I mean it\u2019s good, the pasta is good. But everything is buried in Parmesan and breadcrumbs.\n\nGot the artichokes, I want to taste artichoke but there\u2019s just so much Parmesan on it. Got the clams also, love clams, but sooo much breadcrumbs on them. Would like to taste the clams instead of just breadcrumb.

I always brought friends and family from out of town so they could experience this great place. However, the last time I had dinner I was completely shocked at the massive increase in prices and the low quality service. The price change is pretty significant and to not have premium service to follow that is pretty disappointing. The server might have been new but did not have great knowledge of the dishes and spilled wine on our table. Lilia used to provide impeccable service with a passionate staff and had reasonably (not by any means cheap) priced pasta. The quality of the food did seem the same but the overall experience did not leave me wanting to return.\n\"(Translated by Google) The pink pepper and cheese pasta was good but a little salty and the other dishes were good but overall too salty and overpowering.\n\n(Original)\n\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u30da\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u3068\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30d1\u30b9\u30bf\u306f\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3084\u3084\u5869\u8f9b\u304f\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u6599\u7406\u3082\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u306b\u5869\u8f9b\u304f\u5473\u304c\u6fc3\u3044\u3081\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\"\n\"Food and service was great.\nThe lamb portion was big (could do without it next time).\nNice mocktail was a bonus!\"\n10/10 food - worth the $$$.

During the day the caffe is great; awesome coffee and pastries \u2014 recommend the cold brew, olive oil cake and the seasonal foccacia. The breakfast sandwich is amazing wish there was more of it.

Pasta dishes were absolute \ud83d\udd25. Great vibe, toughest reservation in the state!! Looking forward to my next visit.\n\"Food here is still excellent, but this place needs a serious refresher on what hospitality looks like. Much of the staff seem to have conflated the popularity of the restaurant with their own sense of self-importance, in a very arrogant way. The food is an elevated experience, but the service really brings you crashing back down.\n\nTwo small but really tacky examples from tonight:\n\n1. When we arrived and the hostess was calling the name of our party, she twice ignored us when we put our hand up and said \u201cthat\u2019s us\u201d. When for the third time we said \u201cno, really, that\u2019s us\u201d she replied \u201csorry, people pretend like they have reservations here all the time, so\u2026\u201d\n\n2. We waited 30 minutes in between our starters and our pasta. When we asked how much longer we\u2019d be waiting our server scoldingly told us that \u201cthe pasta station gets really backed up at this time of night\u201d, or in normal English \u201cyeah it\u2019s really slow, shut up and deal with it\u201d\n\nAgain, food is as always excellent, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth dealing with the overinflated egos of staff, who somehow think that their low effort attempt at hospitality is somehow part of what makes (made?) this restaurant special.\"\nFood is delicious 9/10. Price is 3/10 (but to be fair portion is generous). Ambience 9/10. Budget $100 pp including drinks.\nHouse-made pasta was a highlight.  Soft serve with olive oil was also a great way to end the meal. The wine list is super interesting with so many regional highlights throughout Italy. Sommelier and servers were knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive.\nBest Italian in Williamsburg and maybe Brooklyn. Foccacia is a must do and all the pastas are amazing. Great wines to pair as well\n\"Cannot say enough good things about my meal at Lilia. I went with a group of 4 and ordered 7 dishes and a dessert and it was just the right number. The food is absolutely worth the hype, especially the agnolotti and the mafaldini with pink peppercorn - both were incredibly unique and delicious.\n\nAside from the food, the service and overall atmosphere also deserve 5 stars. Despite having our group wait 30min for a table due to the party before us lingering, the team at Lilia was incredibly kind and apologetic and even brought us a complementary order of the cacio e pepe frittelle.

So glad this place lived up to the hype.\n\"Very simple, yet delicious pasta! We were wanting to have some oven-baked pizza hut Lilia doesn\u2019t sell it. A local friend recommended us this place. Go early or make reservations online. Being tourists, we managed to steal a spot at this place 1.5h before the dinner time.\nWe had a pasta and a grilled lamb steak. The meat dish was so large and good for sharing! The place had a nice atmosphere and good service staff.\"\nWhat is there to say? It's everything you've heard and more. The focaccia is a must-have. The service is perhaps the most welcoming in the city. I can't wait to eat my way through the entire menu.\n\"Amazing!\nWent there for our 10th anniversary and we LOVED it!\nThe house mozzarella was fresh and delicious.\nThe scallops were out-worldly delicious, too bad there were only 2 of them.\nThe pasta are the best I have ever had. The ones with pink Peper corn were amazing. Our favourite were the agnolitti with saffron and honey which are to die for and that we already plan to order next time we visit.\nWe also took shrimps, which were excellent but came with the shell which makes it a bit less glamorous and dirty, so not ideal for a date.\nWe also tried the olive oil ice cream and the olive oil cake, again both excellent.\nI highly recommend going to Lilia. Book it 30 days in advance and I can't recommend the agnolitti enough, this combination of saffron", "doc_id": "adfd7ba3-8cef-4f89-b182-346ddac2d666", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b950a16e42af0cd5fc407b922ff4ad5592de3e65937fc5f752852cebef969ee6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 40382, "end": 44100}, "relationships": {"1": "bdbfafcb-9327-4033-9fa5-8efea359510d", "2": "cec8ef74-6a3f-4a6b-aa41-038cbef66c5c", "3": "2fa5837e-d0d3-403e-8cfa-d6515528fc68"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fa5837e-d0d3-403e-8cfa-d6515528fc68": {"__data__": {"text": "and we LOVED it!\nThe house mozzarella was fresh and delicious.\nThe scallops were out-worldly delicious, too bad there were only 2 of them.\nThe pasta are the best I have ever had.

If you are lucky enough to get a reservation, thank whatever god you pray to and enjoy this modern take on Italian.\nI loooooved the food here. Best Italian food I have had in NYC and totally worth what we paid for. Service is great too! The bread, grilled artichoke so good, scallops were huge and delicious, black bass no knife needed, loooved the mafaldini, fetuccine with lamb was good too, and the olive oil gelato was very different and interestingly delicious. Can\u2019t wait to go back.\nService and ambiance here is immaculate. However I do find the overall experience over hyped. Our meal was fine. Not bad but not mind blowing either. Biggest disappointment was the roasted squash antipasti, strange texture and underwhelming flavours. The saffron Agnolotti was the one and only amazing dish that stood out.\nWorth the buzz\nGreat Italian fare, with wonderful pastas\nUnfortunately this place didn't live up to the hype for me. I was really looking forward to it since I finally got a reservation. The malfaldini was way too Cheesy n bitter. The agnolotti was very good but not worth $30. The squash Appetizer with Walnuts was amazing. The homemade Mozzarella was good. The cacio e pepe balls weren't good at all. It's a shame because I was so hyped for this spot and the staff were so nice.\nIt\u2019s fine. Pretty phoned in.\nGreat pasta. The squash was really good too.\nFantastic! Their scalops are amazing and the safron and honey pasta is just out of this world. I definetly recommed this place.\ngirlfriend happy i happy\nI remember this place as being better. Another Williamsburg staple that is now heading downhill? Perhaps. It was still okay but nothing really wowed us. The broccoli and artichoke were the two best dishes we had. We each had a different pasta, plus agnolotti to share, which was the best dish. The sommelier was very helpful, and knowledgeable hence the 5 stars for service. I'd give this visit a 3.5 if I could. Next time I am craving Italian in the neighborhood I'll definitely be going to Antica Pesa over Lilia. Not worth $100+ a person.\nVery good \ud83d\udc4d\nCute little place. Amazing scones and other pastries.
