Une belle adresse ! A la prochaine fois :)\n\n(Translated by Google)\nA saving meal for the day after. The staff was super nice and allowed me to return with my 2 large suitcases (hold and cabin) so that I could share a meal with my friends before leaving town. I had come before and the quality is top notch, the wide choice of drinks and dishes means that there is something for everyone (even those who don't eat meat like me). Also very filling, I couldn't finish. A beautiful address! See you next time :)\"\nIt's not a bad place but it's on the pricey side, considering the poached eggs were a bit overdone. The serving size is bigger than in other places and the coffee was good.

However, the delicious meal was completely ruined when the restaurant's manager asked us to leave our table as soon as we paid our bill. We had a reservation for 11:30. We paid our bill at 1:00. Our table of four adults collectively paid $200 (!) for brunch (including tax and tip). There was 0 mention of a time limit for the table when we made our reservation -- not to mention that the typical time limit for a table in small restaurants (Passe Compose has a very big space) is 2.5-3 hours, not 90 minutes. The manager could've politely asked us how long we think we would be staying, just so he could give the information to the people who were waiting in line for a table, but that's not what he did. After we paid, he came to our table and said he needed us to leave because he needs our table -- and then proceeded to stand close to our table and stare at us to make us uncomfortable for wanting to stay! I hadn't even finished my coffee! It was the rudest thing I've ever experienced as a customer at a restaurant and I will not be going back.\nThe Foie gras poached egg benedict was amazing.

Great coffee too!\nI usually never write reviews because I respect the hard work it requires to build a business but this time I really couldn\u2019t help myself. Before coming to the restaurant, I viewed the menu online and the dishes looked fantastic. I was very excited to dine here. Upon sitting I realized the menu wasn\u2019t at all what I had seen and the plates that were photographed by the many diners weren\u2019t there either. I went with the Parisian sandwich and my wife went with one of the poached egg options. We had one bite of our food and could not have another. There was not one thing that we liked about our food. The waiter saw that our plates were untouched and asked if we wanted to try something else. Knowing that we most likely weren\u2019t going to like anything else, we said no. After asking for our bills, the other waitress/hostess rudely asked if we knew what we ordered before ordering to which the answer was \u201cof course\u201d. We are no strangers to French cuisine and we often eat out. What\u2019s more frustrating is that we were charged $80 plus tax and tip for two plates that we literally and without exaggeration had two bites out of.\nGreat place to have breakfeast\n\"(Translated by Google) Go there if you want to share photos of beautiful food on social media, if you want to see beauty contests of the plates, if you want to place in your discussion \"\"Yes I had brunch in the past tense\"\", if you want to feel rich by paying $50 per dish ordered.

First time back since and was shocked to see what became of it. Their new poached egg plates are very over-ambitious and exceedingly complicated. The prices overall are completely absurd! If you want high end brunch, there are way better options elsewhere and they're not THAT expensive (Regine, Entre-Pots, Wolf Workman...etc). They give you 1/4 cup of fruit with your French toast and can't even bother removing the leaves from the strawberries. Honestly just feels like a tourist trap type place at this point. Very sad. Never going back.\nHad a great time, thank you!\nA great take on brunch, or a more refined option.\nIt's definitely one of my best place for brunch. It is one of the few places you can reserve.

I think I understand why their recipes tasted so good, it is because of the speciality sauces, hands down. Foie Gras poached goose egg was absolutely breathtaking,of course that depends on your palette for fois gras and how you feel about the ethics of it all. It tasted  incredibly delicate paired with the radish and the sauce! I highly recommend you try it! The French toast made from Panko fried bread, paired with the maple syrup and the yoghurt is a must have. I also gave the Le Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9 sandwich a try which has the boar meat which might be a personal choice. I wasn\u2019t a big fan because if you haven\u2019t had boar before is a very lean version of pork+beef. It tasted a little too gamey for my taste and it was chewy which the hostess warned me about.
