But, to be honest, the food didn't really live up to the hype, especially when you think about the price and the wait to get in.\n\nThe halibut we got was cooked unevenly, with the top part tasting like canned fish and only the bottom being sort of good. The sauce was nice, but it couldn't save the dish. The lamb, on the other hand, was too salty and came with bland peas, so the whole meal just felt off.\n\nJust so you know, we ate at Garde Manger the night before without any expectations and had a way better time there, especially when you think about the cost.\n\nThe good part was that we sat near the bar and got great service from Michael, the bartender. The place had a cool, modern vibe, but it makes me wonder if its reputation is a bit overblown. We're big Anthony Bourdain fans, so we really wanted to love it here, but it ended up being just okay.\"\nJoe Beef was one of the many reasons we first visited Montreal.

If you're a foodie and have Montreal on your list this restaurant must be a top priority. From the wine selection, to the appetizers, to the entrees it is thoroughly thought out and wonderful French cuisine.\n\nThe staff are fantastic at recommending, which wines pair best with each dish or even just your overall palette. I had a Chenin Blanc to start and finished with a dry Riesling and it went wonderfully with the escargot, lobster pasta, and the filet with foie gras.\n\nEscargot: Melts in your mouth. If you are skeptical about trying escargot or absolutely love it, this is the place to order it. They're cooked to perfection and brought out with a large slice of baguette. This dish is packed with flavor and is a must try.\n\nBeef Filet with Foie Gras: If I ever come back I will be ordering this for myself. My husband I split this because we ordered so much other dishes, but it was so delicious we were tempted to order a second. We ordered it medium rare, the foie gras was not overwhelming at all. It complimented the steak very nicely in addition to the reduction on top.\n\nThe famous Lobster Pasta: I was told in advance that this dish is a must.

I was looking for beef, only to discover it was fine French cuisine.\nA must try if you\u2019re in Montr\u00e9al! Everything on the menu is delicious\nGreat experience, lives up to the hype. Thank you Anthony Bordain for the rec \ud83e\udd24\nI want to start off saying that I think Joe Beef's reputation is well deserved. I learned about Joe Beef from that Bourdain episode where he visited Quebec. I then found out both cookbooks were at my local public library, so borrowed them. After reading them and trying to replicate a recipe or two, I became infatuated with the idea of going to Montreal and trying this place out. Fast forward through a global pandemic, my wish finally came true last month. My family members from Montreal showed me cool restaurants around town during my time in the city, but my first meal had to be Joe Beef. When I compare Joe Beef to some other restaurants I went to, and take into account that their cookbook outlines their excellent dishes that can be made and tweaked at home to fit your pallette, I struggled to find good value for money in our evening at the restaurant. The service was great. The drinks and food were excellent. It was a special experience, and it set the bar extremely high for my dine-out expectations in Montreal. Truly, Joe Beef is a 5* experience. My current thought, however, is that it is a one-time visit. When I revisit Montreal, I don't know if I'd go back because there are so many interesting restaurants in this city that are marginally priced but crazy delicious. This is only one Vancouverite's opinion. Try this place out and make your own.\nWe were excited to try out Joe Beef as my fianc\u00e9 is a huge fan of meats and fine dining experiences in general. I booked us a table for his birthday two months in advance too! Upon arriving (on a Friday evening) at the restaurant, we were not greeted by anyone but eventually, a hostess did appear and told us to wait while she finished a phone call. We waiting for what felt like 5-10mins until she could give us any attention. Once at our table, the hostess took our coats and we waited 10-15 minutes for our waitress to arrive and provide us with water.

We eventually ordered the bone marrow soup and scissor (Caesar) salad + the bread service. The apps came before the bread which I found quite odd. However, the food was delicious and unlike anything I\u2019ve had in Montreal so props to the chef! Great culinary experience! My fianc\u00e9 had the hanger steak and potatoes and I had the lamb. Both were exceptional. My only advice to the restaurant is to work on the service as it is very off putting to feel like you\u2019re waiting on yourself. I also feel for the waitresses as they had a difficult time explaining the menu to us- they didn\u2019t have much of a voice left after yelling over the loud music all night!! I would come back for the great food but a few major changes are needed to raise the rating to 5 stars.\nThe food was impeccable and the place was beautiful. I give it 4 out of 5 stars only because our waiter was shockingly forceful in convincing us to order more food, even when we said multiple times that we didn't want to. I've never experienced such a pushy waiter before and it made us quite uncomfortable. I suspect this was an attempt to get a bigger tip. Unsurprisingly we ended up with WAY too much food and our bill was higher than we would have wanted. Overall, it's worth a visit but don't let yourself get tricked into ordering too much, because the portions were huge. My favourites were the escargot and the lobster spaghetti!\nWe had a great dining experience. I highly recommend Joe Beef.\n\"Difficult reservation to get, and 1000 reasons that is the case.  Incredibly inventive menu.  Superbly fun, engaging, and professional team approach staff.  Multiple occasions asked for something and then out of thin air someone else appeared and filled the request.  SMOOTH.  Great value to cost ratio.  Easy to find something on the menu, you may have never even heard about, but paired with long term classics such as their lobster spaghetti.\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Plan way ahead.

Thank you Isabelle and Camilo who was constantly keeping our table tidy, our water filled, and our settings freshened between each course!\nIncredible Montreal restaurant worth visiting. The lobster pasta is incredible and definitely worth a try. The ambiance in the restaurant is cozy, and the service was amazing. The oysters were very fresh and shucked nicely.

It's not very spacious but very charming!\nI came a little late to join my group of friends who had initially ordered the big size lobster pasta & meat plater. They expressed that they we satisfied with the food but nothing more. I myself always wanted to try the lobster spaghetti which is what I ordered. It was good but nothing special. The meal was a little on the salty side but still enjoyable. I believe that because of my high expectations, I was really looking for remarkable flavors or something different/special. The food is ok. Just not amazing. The cocktails are very good & amazing service. So, yes I could see myself maybe going back... But wouldn't be my first choice.\nI've heard wonderful things about Joe Beef but have never been able to get reservations when I'm in the city.

It had a faint but pleasant horseradish / dijon taste to it which was very nice and the lobster spaghetti was creamy and delicious. Lobster often gets lost / overpowered in pasta dishes with ingredients like tomatoes but this was not the case here. The lobster was the star of the dish on a bed or creamy spaghetti that included pancetta and chives.

I wanted to love it :(\nSo many people recommended this restaurant to us for our first dining experience in Montreal. Grabbed a table two months in advance. Was underwhelmed. Both beef dishes were medium-well to well-done (very uneven). Was brought the wrong bottle of wine twice. Unfortunately, this wasn't the place for us.\nWorth the hype! We arrived late for our reservation but they were able to hold the table for us. The waiter was so thorough in explaining the menu and making recommendations. The room was cozy and lively. Our favourites included the fois gros \u201ccontinental breakfast\u201d, the lobster spaghetti (naturally), and the scallops.\nWe ordered the terrine de foie gras, lobster pasta and cote de boeuf. Despite making a reservation two months in advance, the restaurant failed to live up to their hype and didn't offer anything extraordinary. The lobster pasta had small pieces of lobster and the cote de boeuf was served without any sides. Although the food was decent, it was nothing exceptional and could easily be made at home. We paid a total of 412 CAD for the meal, which we found to be overpriced given the quality and quantity of the food.\nFANTASTIC\nThe food and service are fantastic.

I need to add ONE example. I felt ashamed to mention it in my first edit, because I don't like to admit that I have been manipulated by a waitress:  Looking at the (out of season) Oysters list on the black board, I told my friend how much I prefer east-coast oysters vs west-coast, and how much I dislike fatty ones and that we should order three each (~5$ a piece!) to avoid the one kind I don\u2019t like. When the waitress came for our order, I told her we would like to start with SIX oysters and that I \u2026 [suddenly I am being shut] \u00ab You have to order EIGHT\u2026 because there are FOUR on the menu today, you have to try FOUR each.\u00bb\u2014> To be honest, I instantly hated being at this place from that moment, and it was only after 12 minutes. The glass of my 5-years-daydreaming-about-this-place just shattered. Let me tell you how much I hated the taste of that fourth oyster I never wanted.\"\nI\u2019m leaving 5 stars for the restaurant and all of the staff except for our waiter. The hostess and bartender were fantastic. I cannot express how much we enjoyed the food and atmosphere but our server pushed the most expensive items and was relentless to the point that seemed humorous to him. It was incredibly frustrating that every dish we ordered needed to find an addition by him for more money.

Loved the cocktails, the appetizers, main dishes and desserts. Make sure to try their salad - it\u2019s special and delicious. The lamb was beautifully cooked. Their side of mashed potatoes is sooo gooood (a bit pricey at $23 but I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it). The almond cake wasn\u2019t heavy at all (it was thinly sliced) and I just wish there was more of it :))\nHighly recommended!\"\n\"(Translated by Google) I recently dined here for a friend's birthday. The meal was excellent, all of a very high standard with attention to detail. The only bad surprise among the beautiful dishes, a quarter of a baguette at $8, can be homemade (doubtful), something which is perhaps not abnormal here but surprising for a restaurant which presents itself as French.\n\n(Original)\nJ\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment d\u00eener ici pour l\u2019anniversaire d\u2019un ami.

Oysters were otherworldly and the Old Fashioned was one of the best I've had.\nMusic is unbearably loud, food is good but extremely over priced.\nGreat ambiance and staff. Food was not for me. Very old school and all the tastes blended in one.\nFrench menu only. Staff go over the menu and are really nice. Oysters were amazing, really liked the lobster pasta too.\nYou can't be wrong with the Lobster Spaghetti", "doc_id": "17c5c5ab-eb97-415f-8940-2b9f827ee713", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6cb6bb7160fe5baec165eb4ad9202dd2e0189bea3abc0e8e975f4fb5b31fb705", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 43687, "end": 44705}, "relationships": {"1": "6465a0aa-3908-479d-8f92-1de1f498a3bc", "2": "c2bb517a-c7ae-4c8e-adff-889793d4e84e"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
