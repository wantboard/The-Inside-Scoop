\\cf0 A Michelin star restaurant that is so worth every penny! An absolute must try! <br><br>Let me first start off by saying that the service here is impeccable and the interior is modern and chic. We were a group of 5 and the waitress informed us that they have a tasting menu that is completely customizable. You&#39;re able to tell them if you&#39;d like certain dishes specifically, or omitted, and if you have a preference with more seafood or more meats. We started the night with some drinks that were refreshing and tasty. <br><br>First off, the tasting menu is SO worth it at $100 per person, the portions are HUGE and we were stuffed by the end of it. Now, onto the good stuff that were served based on our preference (we like both seafood and meats):<br><br>Dry Aged Amberjack Aguachile: 10/10<br>- Amberjack was fresh and came with a citrusy sauce that was a great appy to start the meal with.<br><br>Sikil Pak: 10/10<br>- The presentation of this was very interesting, with cabbage poking out from the dish, but it was absolutely packed with nutty flavours. <br><br>Scallop Ceviche: 9/10<br>- Came in a black sauce so it was hard to see the ingredients. Still enjoyed this but the dry aged amberjack was definitely a lot better. <br><br>Memela: 8/10<br>- A dish of mushrooms, pea, ramp, roots, etc. It&#39;s a earthier dish that was good but not my favourite of the night<br><br>Empanada Oaxaquena :1000/10<br>- My absolute favourite dish of the night. Imagine this as a big taco to share for the table. The flavours are complex, bold and so delicious. Definitely get this dish when you dine here. <br><br>Newfoundland Scallops: 10/10<br>- Fresh scallops with a delicious sauce. This is a one biter that was packed with flavour in the sauce it was cooked in. <br><br>14oz Ribeye: 10/10<br>- Great for sharing since the slices are already cut for you. The salt on the side was a great touch to the steak with the perfect saltiness.<br><br>Whole Seabream: 10/10<br>- I&#39;m not usually a big fan of whole seabream but this was another delicious dish to the table! Also look how impressive it is to have a whole fish!<br><br>Mushroom: 10/10<br>- Charred mushrooms that had a delicious smokey taste. The creama sauce was a great compliment to the mushrooms. <br><br>Savoy cabbage: 10/10<br>- Another great smokey dish that was hearty, earthy and so tasty. <br><br>To end off the meal, we got the epazote respado which was so refreshing, light and perfect for the tasting menu. <br><br>For a tasting menu of this price and being a michelin star restaurant, this really blew me away. The flavours were all so great, such big portions for the table and the service was incomparable to any I&#39;ve had. I definitely highly recommend this spot, either for", "doc_id": "0eebf22e-1acb-43ab-b44b-4364d142b915", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ae50a7302460edbf024fa2515e9c70bc550366f14e97856b631a21b7d592210a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3118}, "relationships": {"1": "223c0bf5-1f3f-4b1e-99c0-299baea9bed8", "3": "2dc3bb7f-a426-4134-89e2-ecbe77c7f9ab"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2dc3bb7f-a426-4134-89e2-ecbe77c7f9ab": {"__data__": {"text": "a whole fish!<br><br>Mushroom: 10/10<br>- Charred mushrooms that had a delicious smokey taste.

I definitely highly recommend this spot, either for a special occasion or for a regular dine in! What a well deserved Michelin star!\n\\\nThe tasting menu was pretty good, minus the raw stuff (fish &amp; ceviche) but that&#39;s just not my preference. Those that do like it, really enjoyed it. My favs were the scallops, shrimp, wagu steak &amp; veggies. The service was amazing &amp; our server was very charming &amp; knowledgeable. The ambiance was ok, it didn&#39;t give me michelin star vibes but that&#39;s ok, the food &amp; service made up for it.\n\\\nExcellent up scale Mexican affair. Unique and original flavors which makes this place very appealing. Excellent plating and service - well deserved Michelin star\n\\\nService: 4/5<br>The service was attentive throughout the night, from having a coat check option upon arrival to being promply seated at our reservation time. We had initially struggled with booking a table weeks prior for our party of 8 as they refused to seat more than 6 people. After a few discussions through the phone, they agreed to accomodate 8 people (on the day of) if we opted for a prix fixe tasting menu. The waiters were vigilant with replacing our plates and cutlery after each course and the dishes came out in a timely manner.<br><br>Atmosphere: 4/5<br>I loved the open kitchen concept and we were seated close enough to catch glimpses of the food as it was being cooked. There is seating at the bar available if you want a more immersive experience and front-row seats to the open flames. The restaurant smells delightful with the different aromas and smokiness. Due to the size and shape of the dining area, there are people constantly walking up and down the aisle beside the tables which can be a little distracting.<br><br>Food: 3.5/5<br>Onto the food! As a Michelin-star restaurant, the expectations were set high. We were able to try most of the dishes at the restaurant based on their curated tasting menu, with the chefs allowing us to request anything specific we wanted them to include. For appetizers, the dry-aged amberjack aguachile had a nice taste by itself, but was served with pickled watermlon rind so acidic that it overpowered the fish completely. The Hokkaido scallops had a nice and refreshing flavour. The tlayuda (a fried tortilla topped with choriza, salsa, beans, and other toppings) was unique with different spices and flavours. For the mains, the Newfoundland scallop, whole sea bream, and octopus were tasty, but nothing to write home about. My personal favourite was the bone marrow with Argentinian shrimp, served with tortillas to be eaten as a taco. The fattiness of the bone marrow was amazing with that melt-in-your-mouth feel and complemented the shrimp very well. The shrimps were large and plump with a nice smokey flavour. The Australian wagyu was a good steak, but did not meet the expectations or price tag of wagyu. The duck breast was mediocre and chewy, and without much seasoning on the duck itself, it relied heavily on the", "doc_id": "2dc3bb7f-a426-4134-89e2-ecbe77c7f9ab", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "426873c818bbc45abad201d4d44dedce85bbc43c74db86c32ce254be07458c45", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2576, "end": 6177}, "relationships": {"1": "223c0bf5-1f3f-4b1e-99c0-299baea9bed8", "2": "0eebf22e-1acb-43ab-b44b-4364d142b915", "3": "5a8f76c0-dd8c-4282-b46b-0284d0bcb8fd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a8f76c0-dd8c-4282-b46b-0284d0bcb8fd": {"__data__": {"text": "with choriza, salsa, beans, and other toppings) was unique with different spices and flavours.

Overall, although the dishes were delicious, they were either hit or miss and we were left a little underwhelmed. <br><br>Drinks: 5/5<br>The cocktails were received well by my group and contained either tequila or mezcal as the base, consistent with the Mexican-inspired food. They also make custom cocktails upon request that are tailored to your preferences. After our bone marrow course, they prompted one person from the table to do a shot off the empty bone, which was a fun little experience for the group.\n\\\nHappy to finally score a reservation at this place. I got a empanada Oaxaquena and we shared the mushroom dish. I was very impressed by both dishes. <br><br>The mushrooms were perfectly charred and lightly seasoned. There sauce was a bit salty, spicy and refreshing, a great compliment to the mushrooms.<br><br>The empanada was served with a crunchy heirloom corn tortilla, refreshing radishes and a tangy hot sauce. The lamb itself was tender and had amazing flavour. <br><br>The restaurant was spacious and had a nice vibe. The waiters and bar tenders were attentive and friendly.\n\\\nI had such a fantastic experience last night at Quetzal! I reserved this place for my fianc\\'e9s birthday dinner, and it was our first Michelin start restaurant experience. I have to say, Quetzal really did live up to the hype!<br><br>To start, we ordered the scallop ceviche. It was super fresh and citrusy tasting, with a lot of different textures. You get a nice creaminess from the avocado and a good crunch from the crispy leeks on top. The scallops were so great and fresh tasting as well! <br><br>The next thing we ordered was the lamb empanada and I think this was one of my favourite dishes!! It reminded me a lot of a birria taco, and it came with this delicious, slightly spicy salsa on the side. The lamb was also incredibly tender and flavorful inside as well!<br><br>For vegetables we did half sweet potato and have mushrooms so we could try both dishes. These were actually some of my favorite dishes as well! The sweet potato was coal roasted and had this incredible smoky flavour, and was topped with this chili oil type of salsa! So delicious and creamy! The mushrooms were so good as well, they also had a great smoky flavour, and they were very meaty-tasting. I honestly didn&#39;t even feel like I was eating a mushroom! <br><br>We also tried the Al pastor, which was great as well! We got it with tortillas so we could make tacos out of it! The flavours and textures were good, but to me it didn&#39;t stand out the way the other dishes did. <br><br>We ended with the almond cake which was good, but again not a stand out dish compared to the other things we tried. <br><br>Overall I had an excellent experience here. Service was amazing and attentive, and I recommend doing the chef&#39;s seating for a really cool experience!

Overall, everything tasted excellent, totally changed my impression for Mexican foods. Tacos can taste so different, tortillas can be so interesting and flavorful.<br>I especially like the pork with oysters mushrooms which is phenomenal!<br><br>Interior decoration is modern and stylish. Highly recommended\n\\\nWe came here for dinner as a big group as we heard that it recently got a Michelin star and it definitely lived up to the expectations. When we walked in, we noticed the high quality of the service immediately as we were immediately seated, and the wait staff were attentive to us all night.<br><br>We ordered a large variety of items such as the scallops, steak, pork, shrimp, bone marrow, and then several desserts at the end. The steak was good but considering the price I think you&#39;re better off getting a nice steak at a steakhouse instead. I would recommend instead to try the interesting and creative dishes. <br><br>My favourite dish of the night was the Al Pastor the pork was very juicy and the pineapple flavour was a really nice touch.

The scallops were delicious and you get a little kick of chili which was delightful. The lamb barbacoa empanada was also a favourite. I would have easily had two to my face. The Dulce del leche was top tier, a nice end to the night.<br><br>The service was kind of awkward, as there were a lot of people passing by and hovering but weren&#39;t so attentive at the same time. My friend also requested a candle for our birthday girl when she made our reservation, but it was forgotten. (Another table celebrating a birthday had the same dessert come out with a candle.)

Then the lingering spiciness that creeps up to remind you: &#34;Hey, I&#39;m still here.&#34;<br><br>Newfoundland scallops comes out on a plate of such beautiful shells and color that you can&#39;t help but to say wow. The scallops are super fresh, cooked to perfection with a slightly springness. What brings everything all together is the sourness of the butter and the saltiness of the sea asparagus that is so unique. <br><br>The octopus and flat iron steak are cooked to perfection. Steak, wall to wall medium rare, no grey bands. Octopus, fresh, perfectly springy yet tender. Unfortunately, these flavours not to say that they&#39;re bad are just too unfamiliar to me. The black garlic mole negro is made with 30 ingredients (usualy includes chocolate, chiles, nuts, seeds, etc.), it has a earthy, funky flavour that is very distinct and I would say took me a while to get used to. It reminded me of Samyang sauce from Spicy noodles except with a little more depth and dimension. The octopus flavour reminded me of Portuguese roast chicken, maybe something like Nando&#39;s but on Octopus. One thing I didn&#39;t like was that I thought the octopus needed a little more acid, however, the acid was found more on the brussel sprout leaves. So if you didn&#39;t have any brussel sprout leaves to eat with the octopus, you wouldn&#39;t be able to appreciate the flavours to the fullest. <br><br>I believe their ice cream is home made with fresh passion fruit. The tartness along side the textual element from the passion fruit seeds contrasts nicely with the smooth, sweetness of the avocado ice cream. The coconut sugar tuile is a nice crunchy component which ties everything together making it a perfect palate cleanser. <br><br>Overall, for a Michelin restaurant, I think service could be a little more elevated as some of the other Michelin restaurants I&#39;ve been to have faired a bit better. As well as, it would be nice to see more intentionality with the plates to add more artistic value to the plating of the dish.\n\\\nWow. Just wow.

Again, all the dishes were fantastic but two stood out. These were the pork secreto al pastor and bone marrow &amp; wild Argentinian shrimp. I have never tasted pork so flavourful and tender and if I had a choice of only one item to order from Quetzal, it would be this. The bone marrowe and shrimp were served on taco wraps and made delicious fillings!<br><br>Quetzal is a must-try and a repeat for me!\n\\\nHands down recommend visiting this Mexican spot. They recently received a Michelin star and it&#39;s very well deserved.<br><br>The food was authentically Mexican and mixed the right flavor profiles of savory, spicy and citric. We ordered the \\'a0empanada oaxaque\\'f1a and the lamb was well seasoned and juicy. Our fave masa entree was tlayuda. It somewhat reminds me of the Mexican pizza available at Taco Bell in the US, but to such a higher better quality - it has amazing chorizo on it. For main entrees we ordered grilled mushroom, puerco estilo al pastor and octopus with fresh tortillas. It&#39;s hard to discern what was my favorite, but the front runner is the pork. So sweet, tangy and delicious. <br><br>As for drinks all the mezcal based ones were great! They have a wide variety of tequilas and mezcal so recommend trying drinks with that! My favorite was the tequila based espresso martini.<br><br>On top of it being yummy, the service was impeccable. We never needed to ask for a water refill or flag anyone down for a different cocktail.\n\\\nQuetzal was a place I really wanted to visit! The aesthetic of the restaurant was amazing.

It&#39;s just a little effort, which I don&#39;t mind, however, I ended up with two staff hunting down a small enough spoon/fork to be able to get the marrow out, making things a bit more of a First World problem. It didn&#39;t really make sense to me that they didn&#39;t see that coming. It was nice that they provided a hot towel to clean up, though it came before we started eating, so they were cold by the time we needed to use them. My friend ordered the empanada oxaque\\'f1a (lamb), which she said was good and filling. But I think she didn&#39;t get much of a &#39;wow&#39; factor. <br><br>The staff were all very kind and knowledgeable about each dish. The decor was very chic and looked high-end. It&#39;s a good place to try at least once. I just know there are better places for the same price point around the city.\n\\\nThis place is a hidden gem. From outside it&#39;s really unassuming. You walk in and the architecture alone is magnificent. I was absolutely blown away with the incredible flavors in every single dish we tried. It was a special occasion and everyone at our table was impressed with not only the food but the drinks and the service! Stand out dishes were definitely the scallop ceviche appetizer and the scallop entr\\'e9e. The bone marrow dish with the Argentinian crabs were also a hit. My friend got the steak and said it was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this place if you&#39;re in the mood to splurge for an incredible dining experience.\n\\\nMy second time here and the ambiance of this place never disappoints! Hints of the grilling is on the nose but not overpowering thanks to great ventilation of the open kitchen. We had two raw dishes, both consisting of seafood (cured amberjack and scallop) - the flavors were good but not memorable. <br><br>My personal favorite was the pork secreto - general I am not a fan of pork as I find the meat to be dry and a porky flavour. However, this dish was so tender, juicy and flavorful, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The other favourite was the whole grilled branzino which was cooked to perfection. While all the flavors were good, I found the seasoning of salt to be a bit heavy handed in the grilled items, so if you want to limit the sodium, consider asking for lighter on the salt. Although the food was generally delicious, the price point was high relative to the quantity and the ingredients.\n\\\nWe went for a birthday meal with some friends and shared the food.

The inside of the restaurant seemed pretty packed but the patio was pretty much empty, so we snagged a table without much of a hassle.<br><br>We were basically looking to try a couple of things and have a few drinks, so we only wound up ordering two food items:<br><br>Corn &amp; Tomato Salad (&#34;poblano kosho, cotija, anaheim crema, queso fresco, chips&#34;). This is a pretty decent salad, and it&#39;s pretty decent value for the cost. The various components all worked well together, although the tomatoes certainly felt as though they could&#39;ve been riper. I will say, however, that the concoction didn&#39;t seem as flavorful as it could&#39;ve been.<br><br>Hokkaido Scallops (&#34;green garlic butter, pickled ramps&#34;): Now this dish, on the other hand, kind of blew me away in terms of taste and presentation. The small scallops were cooked perfectly, and that green garlic butter sauce was irresistible and addictive. Were we essentially drinking that sauce after we&#39;d eaten the scallops? We weren&#39;t not drinking that sauce, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>The only downside to our experience was the service. Our server&#39;s presence was extremely sporadic throughout our meal, which meant that there were long stretches where our drinks were sitting empty in front of us. It was disappointing, to say the least.\n\\\nSo creative! Their staff Matthew suggested the tasting menu and I&#39;m so glad we went with that. \\'a0We got to sample amazing dishes. <br><br>Drinks were delicious as well. Usually when I ask for a mocktail, it&#39;s nothing fancy but Queztal bar served up some flavourful contoction. Great evening after a while.

Great flavour and texture! The roasted bone marrow was also good but didn&#39;t have as much marrow as I like. The taste was a bit Asian similar to a black bean sauce.

Various grills and cooking stations made up the majority of the left side of the restaurant, while dining tables made up the majority of the the right side. There was also a dinning section at the front of restaurant and another ten tables or so outside on the patio. The ventilation system throughout the restaurant was excellent but worth noting, your clothes are going to smell like charcoal for the rest of the night.<br><br>We ordered several dishes to share - corn &amp; tomato, two orders of 2 piece blue corn masa cakes, stuffed triangular thin corn masa, coal roasted sweet potatoes, green salad, sweet breads, grilled whole sea bream and spiced Mexican chocolate sorbet for dessert.<br><br>I was not a big fan of the sweet breads - I found them to be pretty bland, dry and not worth the price. The mole negro they were served with was very good, but it&#39;s intense flavour completely overpowered the sweet breads and when mixed together, the mole was the only thing you could even taste.<br><br>The 2 piece blue corn masa cakes and the whole sea bream were the best dishes we ordered - the sea bream with salsa rojas and salsa verde was grilled to perfection - the skin was crispy, the fish was extremely tender and the homemade salsa verde just went so well with it - we all agreed it was the best dish of the night, it was absolutely incredible. Our dessert was really tasty and had a great balance of spiciness from the chocolate sorbet, sweetness from the sponge toffee and sourness from the sea buckthorn berry.<br><br>In summary - the service was solid, the interior was cool and overall the food was very good.

But there was no one dish that I was head over heels with. However the full tasting menu experience was well put together. Only complaint would be the wait times between each course. We found it a bit slow. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because we ate too fast but most tasting menus we&#39;ve done the courses started to overlap midway. <br>My favourite dish of the night was definitely the main course sea bream.

I didn&#39;t care much for the watermelon radish slaw and the only thing that really made it flavourful was the sauce that came with a creeping heat. <br>In conclusion, it was a beautiful dining experience, everything was well prepared and yummy but nothing blew my mind.\n\\\nThe restaurant has a nice cozy setting, but we got in there quick and left early due to our busy schedule. \\'a0My friend has the grilled asparagus and we shared chorizos and empanadas. These were definitely not bad. Our friends who we heard about this restaurant from were not too impressed of some of the dishes this place has, and the menu was confusing. \\'a0But we thought the food was overall good however, we would like to have a shot at some of the alcohol options next time.\n\\\nMr.H and I were here for a celebratory dinner, right when you walk in this place has a modern and minimalist ambiance, very different from most other mexican restaurants.

So good! One of the dishes had peanuts which wasn&#39;t listed on the menu (...) BUT they were able to replace it right away due to an allergy. <br>We came here on a Friday night and was able to grab a sit fairly easily. Dishes range between $15-30 and are meant to be shared. I would go back! But maybe for special occasions only.\n\\\nParticularly in light of the rave reviews it has received, I was ultimately disappointed with my experience at Quetzal. Designed by a well-known architect who teaches at the University of Toronto, Quetzal impresses in the realms of architecture, plating, and overall aesthetics. It is clear, however, that such is the price one pays for atmosphere, as the menu is simply not up to par. Though the variety of the cocktails offered is excellent, the departure of the original staff seems to have resulted in increasingly bland and unimaginative flavors.\n\\\nThis restaurant fills two gaps in Toronto:<br>1) a modern take on Mexican cuisine <br>2) a casual fine dining restaurant with an interesting take on both meat and seafood <br><br>This restaurant also has some of the most knowledgeable and service oriented wait staff I have ever encountered.

Our server was extremely knowledgeable fo all the menu items and food preparation. <br>Cocktails are amazing as well. 100% Taste was great. Although a bit too pricy. The wine is overpriced too, which I guess it&#39;s typical for this type of restaurant. But that&#39;s where you lost the fifth star - overpriced alcohol.\n\\\nFun night of cocktails and shared dishes with friends. A beautifully run restaurant, it was fast paced, vibrant and delicious. We were all very happy with the food, and service. Can&#39;t wait to go back with my beau! xo\n\\\nI was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.<br><br>For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. <br><br>Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn&#39;t seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. <br><br>Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. <br><br>It&#39;s a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I&#39;m just not the right fit for palette.\n\\\nWhile we are Mexican cuisine aficionados, our experience with the food hasn&#39;t strayed far from the quotidian comforts of Chipotle and Taco Bell.

I love a good ceviche, and I was so excited to try this after seeing pics on other bloggers&#39; feeds about the Mixto. When it arrived, the dishes didn&#39;t match: there was less than half the amount of scallops as the blog post I referenced from a year ago. The dish itself was pretty good - it was halibut + scallops in a sour, acidic bath.<br><br>Citrus salad 4/5 We really enjoyed this salad, and the simplicity in ingredients really surprised us. It featured grapefruit, navel oranges, and a green salsa. Atop the oranges were sous vide chayote slices to give it a light crunch. <br><br>Blue corn masa cakes 5/5 This dish was the highlight of our night. The consistency of the cakes was absolutely amazing - it was crispy yet soft at the same time. It&#39;s hard to believe that this was a vegetarian dish; the mushrooms were extremely juicy and worked perfectly with the cheese. We could&#39;ve eaten 5 of these each.<br><br>Sweet potato 3/5 This dish was highly recommended on yelp, but it wasn&#39;t fantastic. The yam was good, but tasted boiled - the smoke didn&#39;t really get through. The sauce was good - it resembled Lao Gan Ma closely - a Chinese black bean peanut paste. Overall, things didn&#39;t really mix together. If you do get this though, make sure to order a batch of tortillas to make sweet potato tacos!<br><br>To sum up our critique of this place, we think it&#39;s fallen to the classic trap that fancy establishments fall prey to when trying to modernize a classic cuisine: losing the integrity of the flavours. Everything felt too refined, not punchy enough. While we understand the value of restraint and nuance, we can&#39;t help but think that the fieriness that defines Mexican cuisine was overly diluted. Quetzal ranked 23 out of Canada&#39;s best 100 restaurants. While it was a tasty meal, we wouldn&#39;t put it in our top 50. <br><br>Also there&#39;s only 1 washroom. This means long lines. Don&#39;t hold it in.\n\\\nExcellent value for tasting menu. Lots of bonus surprises and perks for our special occasion. Tasty food. Smoky atmosphere.\n\\\nThe service was quite good with pleasant hosts and knowledgeable servers. \\'a0The menu has a broad selection of share plates and all items sampled were very good (especially the ceviche and the grilled whole sea bream). \\'a0However the wine list is quite limited with an exclusively new world selection and the standard by the glass pour was quite small and very expensive for what it was. \\'a0Also, the recommendation of 5 share plates for 2 persons results in an extremely expensive dinner. \\'a0The venue also has low ceilings with poor ventilation with no location to escape the kitchen smoke so you leave remembering the evening by the smell of dinner on your clothes. \\'a0Overall would be an interesting culinary adventure if at a better price point.\n\\\nSay at the chef bar and that gave us a real appreciation for how much everyone really cared.

The space is narrow and beautifully designed to maximize the diner experience, without overcrowding. Service is impeccable and comfortable - there&#39;s a genuineness to lengths the servers will go to ensure you&#39;re happy. In terms of quality of food - all I can say is excellent. You&#39;ve got lots of authenticity here, and some creativity that does&#39;t disrespect the cuisine or bastardize it. <br><br>A must visit.

Next visit I plan to try the seabream and the steak &amp; leeks...\n\\\nReally delicious food that takes a twist on traditional Mexican cuisine. Tried the mixto ceviche, sweet potato, salad, octopus and wagyu beef steak. Beautiful interior, not too dark, not too loud. 4 stars given due to prices but food is 5/5!\n\\\nQuetzal is interesting. There&#39;s this big huge space that goes for miles with a glimpse into kitchen. At the front, there&#39;s a huge table with natural light, and the bar is impeccably stocked and gorgeous. We sat at the bar, and it was fun conversing with our server who was full of quips and stories. His drinks were equally interesting. <br><br>The food though, for Mexican just wasn&#39;t as great as the rest of the restaurant itself.

(Thanks!) Upon arrival, I was seated swiftly, and to my delight, they made us a table for 4. I ordered an appie to share as folks arrived... it was the guacamole/white bean dip. It was amazing! The first bites just made our palates feel alive, with lots of lime, the perfect amount of salt, and fresh chips. <br><br>Drinks arrived quickly, and refill offers were always perfectly timed. Two of us enjoyed the dry cider, and the others loved Quetzal&#39;s take on the margarita. <br><br>All of the food that I ordered was delicious and flavourful - the citrus salad, the tetela (they offered to sub mushrooms in lieu of cheese which was both a great suggestion and a lovely gesture), and the coal roasted sweet potato. I will dream about the citrus salad and the sweet potato for weeks, I&#39;m sure, and I can&#39;t wait for another special occasion so that I can go again!<br><br>What really made this a 5-star experience though was the service. At all times the staff moved around the restaurant masterfully and with purpose. Any staff member passing by the table who noticed an empty glass, remedied it. Food deliveries were swift and coordinated, with correct plates going to correct individuals every single time (even though the deliveries were not always made by the person who took our order.) Someone promptly arriving to thoroughly explain each dish, since they are complex, and we likely needed a reminder of the details from the menu. Bussing was never early, always well timed, and then amazingly, another staff would promptly arrive to clean the table. Staff would gently peek at the table to make sure every aspect of your experience was perfect, while never interrupting mid-conversation. Every detail had been rehearsed a million times to deliver absolute perfection. Watching them was as enjoyable as going to a Broadway Musical! I loved it!\n\\\nI loved this place and will come back every time im in toronto.<br><br>We had the asparagus dish, sweet potato with peanuts and pea shoots, triangular corn masa, white bean dip, skirt steak, sunchokes.

For a good time, dip that steak in the scallops&#39; butter sauce.\n\\\nCame in for a birthday dinner and truly enjoyed the fusion of flavours. You ve got to try the chorizo,steak and ceviche.\n\\\nAfter a recent trip to the Yucatan and experiencing authentic Mexican wood-fired cuisine, I have been on a mission to find similar flavours in the city of Toronto. From the moment you walk into the restaurant, Hands down quetzals interior design is beautiful. The sloped ceiling creates an inviting appearance to the dining room and the open fires at the back, fill the space with a smell that instantly indicated that I was in the right place. We ordered many tastes from the menu. We started with several veggie dishes including the grilled asparagus, green salad and grilled runner beans. The favourite from the veggie dishes were the runner beans. They have a similar bite to cactus without the slimey texture. The addition of coconut and cotija cheese added unique flavours and textures to the earthy veggies. The restaurant makes its own masa based dishes and we opted for the Mamelas and the empanada. Both dishes were gluten free and delicious. The mamelas were a flavour bomb with trumpet mushrooms and a cheese sauce. For meat, we had the chorizo, steak and sweet breads. To be honest, the steak was a bit chewy and not a favourite of the group. The sweet breads however, were unreal. I have never had sweet breads before and the way that they were prepared at quetzal proved just how delicious a organ meat can be. For dessert we had the avocado ice cream with GRASSHOPPERS and a passion fruit mousse. I never thought I would enjoy grasshoppers but they truly added the most unique texture in contrast to the smooth creamy ice cream. All in all, quetzal puts an elegant spin on true traditional Mexican fare...this place is worth a visit and the hefty bill.\n\\\nWe had an amazing time here ! Sat in the back at the chefs table which was so fun to watch the action. It was also nice to chat with the chefs. Some people mentioned it was quite warm - they did have some serious fans going on back there but it is warmer than usual. Keep that in mind if you&#39;re sensitive to heat but I was very comfortable. I think these reservations go fast so book early if you wish! <br><br>We ordered five dishes: two masa (chicken and mushroom), roasted sun chokes, octopus and chorizo. The real stand out was the octopus, this was incredible. Served with pineapple and squash and a spicy sauce. Chorizo and sun chokes were also absolutely delicious.

We opted for no dessert but it was my birthday so the server bought us out dessert anyway which was also a very kind gesture. The dessert was a chocolate sorbet with passion fruit which was quite interesting. <br><br>I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return to try more dishes.\n\\\nThis is the place for you if you like over-priced inauthentic airplane-quality food.

The interior is stunning and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. \\'a0We got 5 dishes and a couple of cocktails between the two of us.

Everything is to share and can be split between 3 people, TOPS. 2 is ideal I&#39;d say. If you like food that&#39;s hot out of the kitchen this is NOT the place for you. Lukewarm to say the least and just not outstanding. They say you get what you pay for but the lack of flavor and overall taste of the dishes was just missing something for the price. I&#39;m happy we gave it a try after all these great reviews.<br><br>In closing... Don&#39;t believe the hype. The Ramen place next door was packed and we actually went there after.\n\\\nSitting in front of the grill was super fun, and super hot after a while. \\'a0If you are on a first date, sit somewhere else, unless you are testing for his/her true colour. \\'a0My husband was soaked (still very happy) in front of the heat, I may have been slightly grumpy after he misted water on my face... \\'a0Mist bottle and water provided by the restaurant. \\'a0<br><br>Cocktail - Animal Spirit is a must try, well balanced, goes great with the dishes. \\'a0<br><br>Ceviche - perfectly put together with a variety of seafood and other ingredients, each spoon was a lovely surprise. \\'a0<br><br>Hen - &#34;respect&#34; to the grill master; his hands were pretty much IN the fire without batting an eye... \\'a0I wanted a selfie with him, but of course didn&#39;t ask...

Cudos and respect to the chefs and staff.\n\\\nI had high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but for me, it ended up being just an average meal. <br><br>The restaurant itself is very nice inside. The decor is unique and the feel of the restaurant is upscale yet welcoming. Staff are very friendly and professional. I don&#39;t particularly enjoy the high seats we had, but that&#39;s just me. The menu is a bit confusing so we had a lot of questions, and our server was happy to explain. There were four of us dining and we had intended on ordering our own food, but apparently this restaurant suggests more of a &#34;family style&#34; dining experience. I feel that this is a lazy way of serving, as you&#39;re basically told that they don&#39;t care about timing your food to come out together, so it&#39;s suggested you share whatever comes out first. Not my favourite way to eat when I&#39;m dining with people I don&#39;t know very well.<br><br>One of the guys at our table wanted to order a drink that was under the &#34;Large Format&#34; heading, which our server explained was meant to share. She also said it could be served as a single drink if he wanted. I read the description (Velvet Krush) and decided I&#39;d also like to try it. When our drinks were brought out, it was served as a single drink with two straws. I don&#39;t know what made her think that two people sitting on opposite ends of the table from each other would want to share a drink like that, but we sent it back requesting two separate glasses. Even if we had been a couple, I would not want to share a drink like that. Very strange. At least the drink was really good. Something I would definitely have again. <br><br>We ordered a few ceviche dishes to start. Most of the dishes were good, but at this price point, I honestly expected to be wowed at least with some of the dishes. The presentation was exceptional, which is probably why I was disappointed, as I expected everything to taste as good as it looked. I did enjoy the scallop ceviche - probably my favourite dish of all the ones I tried. <br><br>I had the hanger steak as my main with a side of grilled mushrooms. The steak was cooked rare, which I found to be a bit rubbery. Had it been cooked a bit more to mid-rare, it probably would have been perfect. Because they sliced the steak before bringing to the table, there&#39;s not much you can do to salvage it, aside from ordering a new one. Given the two-hour window they impose, I wasn&#39;t prepared to chance it, as we were over 2/3 of our time already. The mushrooms also looked better than they tasted, as I felt the broth kind of watered down the mushroom flavour rather than enhancing it. I also tasted the grilled fish and the coal roasted sweet potato, but neither was to my liking. It seemed like the char from the grill kind of overpowered everything else. <br><br>At the end of the meal, there was nothing really outstanding for me.

What immediately struck me was the beautiful interior design - the sloping white ceiling, open fires, and intricate wall sconces make it an intimate and cozy environment, transporting you into a different space altogether. <br><br>But you probably want to know about the food \\'a0What to try? A bit of everything! The waiter suggested that we order one dish from each section and that was the perfect amount of food. We started with the Verde Mixto Ceviche, which was fantastic in how the flavours and textures played off each other. Try the flame charred tortillas by themselves, too. We ordered three salsas as well that brought their own unique flavour profiles and were a great interlude in our meal. There&#39;s one with ants in it that I want to go back and try! Next we had one of their Masa (corn dough) dishes - the Tlacoyo - that was a squash based tortilla wrapped around a goat cheese-esque cheese, paired with a flavourful salsa with flame grilled mushrooms, onions, and squash that was just delicious! Next we had one of their daily special dishes from the Verduras (vegetable) section. This for me was one of the highlights of the meal - a perfectly roasted squash \\'a0that was crispy on the outside but firm and rich on the inside, paired with a mole sauce and brussel sprouts with sunflower seeds mixed in. What an experience! Our meal finished with the bavette steak \\'a0that was cooked perfectly medium rare, was seasoned to perfection, and paired with a delectable salsa and roasted cauliflower. We did notice that the steak was a bit tougher to chew, but all in all was great. At the very end, we ordered their Cremoso for Vanilla for dessert, which was such a unique mix of different flavours and textures with meringue, cream, sugared almonds, and citrus presented beautifully in an orange earthenware bowl. <br><br>No meal like this is complete without drinks! My partner got the Como Paulo which she really enjoyed - it is a cocktail with a lightness that belies its complexity, bringing together guava liqueur, cinnamon, lemon, and pink bubbles. I prefer spirit forward drinks and got the Second Set, which was an off the beaten path take on a Manhattan - the coffee and cacao notes really come out in the aftertaste after the initial spirit and sweetness fades away. The restaurant also offered me half of two mezcals as a way to try two - the lighter Mexicano (fruity, with smokiness afterwards) and the heavier Bosscal (petroleum, smoke, burnt rubber) - and they came with the most excellent pickles as well! <br><br>The hospitality was also incredible with attention to the smallest details.

If you&#39;re looking for a nice date night, to celebrate an occasion, or just for a meal to treat yoself, definitely check this place out.\n\\\nBeautiful space and food was great. Went with 4 friends and ordered all 9 salsas, ceviche verde, taleta, tlayuda, arrachera, vegetables in mole verde, and the roasted vidalia onion. Everything was very good (although I didn&#39;t eat the meat/seafood items), but my favourite really was the salsas - great depth of flavours and so nice to add different ones to the meal as we ate. Also got one of the large format cocktails to share amongst us, which was good as well. The service was excellent, cleared plates between courses and very solicitous with refilling water etc (to the point that some friends felt it was a little too much). It is on the expensive side, but the food and service is good. As for folks who aren&#39;t happy with portion sizes, I&#39;d say any place focused on small plates probably isn&#39;t the best fit then.\n\\\nAmazing meal, hands down! Super fresh and appropriate portion sizes. My favourite items were the oysters, the scallop ceviche, the fish ceviche, the steak &amp; dessert! Service and ambiance were also good! Would definitely return!\n\\\nWent on a Sunday, early evening, walked in and ate at the bar. <br><br>My friend and I were impressed with the bartender who was great at describing the food menu and great with suggestions. We thought he had better service than Alo bar at Yorkville. We also had Alo / Aloette staff sitting beside us. They, of course, had industry treatment, super friendly to each other. <br><br>Food was good. Ordered the Masa with the mushrooms with it, enjoyed the salsas with it. The Lamb melts in your mouth, very fatty so you really need the right salsa / acid to go with it. The mushroom was solid as most reviewers had said. The broth was very flavourful but there is something gritty and slightly bitter at the end on the bottom of the bowl. \\'a0We ordered two desserts, one was a chocolate and pear sauce pairing. Not heavy nor too sweet. The second one was a daily special, they call it a Nutella bread with hot chocolate. This hot chocolate is NOT thick, but had a the right spice like in a chai that balances the bread that is a bit on the dry side but the homemade nutella inside was divine!<br><br>The atmosphere is fun. The decor is amazing. The staff was really good.\n\\\nThe best Mexican I&#39;ve had in Toronto hands down. The service was great as well. The steak was incredible. I would order that one again without even thinking twice. I&#39;m gluten free and they easily accommodated my dietary restrictions. <br><br>The decor and ambiance is very chic.

And they have a taste that necessitates eating them immediately. The Ceviche Verde Mixto ($26) was mon plat pr\\'e9f\\'e9r\\'e9. The gleaming, pearly flesh of the scallops and halibut was highlighted with a vibrant green backdrop and were topped with delicate and salty sea asparagus. I equally enjoyed the Aguachile de Camaron ($24), with black radish, jicama, orange, habanero and the most perfectly sliced avocado. The shrimp had been doused with just the right amount of lime juice to transform its flesh to the slightest pink hue. Like many other dishes, the sense of placement in the raw dishes was well-honed. But, beyond its pristine appearance, the taste was superb and it&#39;s now my ceviche of choice in the city.&#34;\n\\\nMy partner (who was visiting from out of town for our anniversary) and I were extremely excited to try this place. Myself, being half latino, I was ecstatic when I heard about a new restaurant opening up with what seemed to be an interesting take on Mexican cuisine.<br><br>I&#39;ll start off with saying our server was extremely cold and downright rude towards us throughout the entire night. Maybe because we look a lot younger than we actually are and she was also helping a loud table next to us and giving them far better service than we received. Regardless, that&#39;s not how customer service works.<br><br>We started off with a cocktail each, I can&#39;t remember what I ordered but it was fine, nothing to write home about. My partner got the Crystal Visions which was absolutely horrible. It tasted like pure celery and fennel :\\\\. We wanted to send it back but we were a bit too timid because our server was so cold.<br><br>Ceviche Verde Mixto: comes served with tortillas. When it was brought out to us the tortillas didn&#39;t come with it to which we had to ask a support staff to grab for us since our server was nowhere to be found. Was really great, quite acidic but it didn&#39;t bother us at all. The scallops were amazing and had a perfect buttery texture. The only downside to this dish was the tortillas. I&#39;m not sure if we got a bad batch or this is how Quetzal serves them all the time but they tasted almost stale? They were very very hard to the point I had to jab them with my fork/knife to break them apart. I mean, if you&#39;re serving a $26 ceviche the least you can do is provide a half decent tortilla.<br><br>After that we had 3 salsas, again I can&#39;t remember which ones because honestly, they were nothing special, 2 of 3 were pretty bland. Loved having to eat these bland salsas with stale tortillas!!!<br><br>Around this time we were done our cocktails and wanted to get some wine. We asked our server to recommend one to us, an Australian wine, which was her &#34;favourite&#34;.

Spanish food done by white folks. In all honesty this was a real dismal meal and a disappointing experience. The decor was forced as was everything on the menu that screamed &#34;I&#39;m trying to be Spanish food.&#34;\n\\\nIt was our first time dining here tonight but it most certainly will not be the last. We live in the neighbourhood and had long wondered what would become of the previously vacant commercial space. We were pleasantly surprised and very pleased to discover it had been utterly transformed. This could easily be a new favourite spot - we really can&#39;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! <br><br>The positives: <br><br>-Courteous, knowledgeable staff, they&#39;re attentive without hovering. Our server introduced various items on the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences. She also took the time to explain the source and cultural aspects of dishes. The restaurant was packed by the time we were halfway through our meal, but the glasses of water were never less than half full at our table (different servers would top it up, depending on whoever spotted it) and they would discreetly and efficiently tidy up the table in between courses as needed. This little bit of extra attention to detail is what we&#39;d expect from a fine dining restaurant but the overall ambiance was relaxed elegance, welcoming and not pretentious at all.

But it&#39;s probably a good thing that I don&#39;t lol <br><br>We were about to opt out of dessert, considering that we were already fairly full. Luckily one of the servers stopped by to describe what the three options were in more detail and we decided to try the xocolatl. It definitely didn&#39;t disappoint, if anything, now that we know what it is we&#39;d be disappointed if we DIDN&#39;T end the meal off by sharing that excellent dark chocolate ice cream with goat&#39;s milk caramel and sea salt drizzle, pear pearls and a praline of sorts. It was perfectly portioned for sharing to end off a memorable meal. <br><br>We will also definitely be back to try the tasting menu sometime. For curious would-be diners, they had ball parked it at $75 per person. <br><br>-Interior Design - The restaurant layout was definitely crafted to showcase the bar, food, and unique atmosphere. It&#39;s stylish without sacrificing functionality, elegant without feeling formal, and most definitely a welcoming spot to enjoy a fantastic meal. <br><br>They are certainly a &#34;pricier&#34; dining option for the neighbourhood, but given the quality of the food and service, the cost is not only fair but also well worth it.\n\\\nThe interior of the restaurant is really nice. The ceiling architecture is very unique, the lines and lights are unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before. Worth checking out just for the interior. <br><br>You can smell the live fire kitchen when you walk through the dining room but I didn&#39;t feel like it was intrusive at all during the meal. <br><br>The food at Quetzal was all really good. We got:<br><br>Scallop ceviche - refreshing, tart, sweet, great way to start the meal. The combination of halibut scallop apple all paired nicely together. Also first time having sea asparagus! <br><br>Tetela masa - this was like an upscale super tasty pizza pocket. At least that&#39;s what I thought of hope the chef doesn&#39;t take offense bc it was freakin tasty. The black bean sauce was super smoooooth. <br><br>Ash roasted beets - the beets rhubarb and avocado puree went well together. Well executed but didn&#39;t really find anything particular unique about this. <br><br>Bavette steak - this was an umami bomb. Porcini rub on the steak and the anchovy caper salsa all contributed to super umami flavours. The charred onion offered a nice break. It was suggested to eat the steak with the black bean sauce from the tetela. This added another creamy dimension to the dish.

Everything was really tasty, well cooked and well balanced.\n\\\nI can&#39;t say enough good things about this restaurant. I made a last minute reservation for 2 (albeit early in the evening on a Saturday of the long weekend) after coming across them on Instagram. We were not disappointed. We ordered two of the specials (seafood cocktail &amp; tuna tostadas), arrachera, hongos, and remolacha. Everything had great flavour and was the perfect portion size. My favourite of the night was the tostadas. We also had the chabacano for dessert and wow; peaches, passionfruit foam, sorbet... The drinks are just as good as the food. We tried both cheladas (both delicious but I prefer the roja) and a few beers for a grand total of about $150 for the two of us. I&#39;d definitely come back for a special occasion dinner to try the butterflied fish and the salsas.\n\\\nVery disappointed! Food was really lacking in flavour - all 4 salsas we ordered with the lamb were very basic and not tasty. Masa with cheese/ zucchini flower/ black bean was dry and had no flavour. Mushrooms were sub-par. Service was the worst part (except for one waiter) but others were belittling / passive aggressive about our seat change even though the bar spots by the fire were extremely hot! Overall very poor experience and will not come back (created an account because I feel so strongly about letting the public know!).\n\\\nVery disappointing. I was so excited to try the new restaurant that I have been reading about since last year and sadly was extremely turned off by it. Although they claimed to be fully booked there were many open tables for long periods during the evening. Eventually we got moved to one from the bar seating after asking multiple times if anyone was occupying the tables. Cocktails were great but it was all downhill from there. Firstly they did not give us the proper menu that contained the special food feastures. We only found out about them long after we had placed our order when the table next to us ordered something we did not see on the menu. When we informed the server he tried to blame it on the fact that we had switched from bar seats to a table which was not where the mishap occurred. We ordered the cheese &amp; black bean masa, Mushrooms, sweet potato &amp; the lamb with the avocado and the sikil patak salsas. The masa was flavourful but contained an awful lot of dough compared to filing. The mushroom dish was great but everything else we ordered was extremely bland and lacked flavour. The lamb was quite gamey and very tender but only came with 1 tortilla each which was definitely not sufficient for the size of the dish and the salsas that accompanied it lacked flavour altogether. We specifically requested that the masa come when it was ready and that all other dishes come together so we could eat them with the lamb. However, the mushrooms arrived first with the sweet potato five minutes later with an even longer pause while awaiting the lamb. When we asked if the lamb was coming and told them of our concern that the other dishes were getting cold while we waited, the server informed us that the three dishes would not all fit on the table at once which is why they didn&#39;t serve them together. This felt like more of an excuse for the error as the lamb was still not ready for another 10 mins after mentioning it and did in", "doc_id": "c5ddfa5a-4639-4a49-9b81-2cd121cffe61", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bba3ac2299ac0d72bdd36cec2d159e27d8739d9b06b7051b09559d4b39ae7624", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 89828, "end": 93789}, "relationships": {"1": "223c0bf5-1f3f-4b1e-99c0-299baea9bed8", "2": "dfc1c4cc-311b-46ca-a0d0-fa627eb4d2ee", "3": "b0f648a3-e3ee-4d58-9522-41f0013be685"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0f648a3-e3ee-4d58-9522-41f0013be685": {"__data__": {"text": "and very tender but only came with 1 tortilla each which was definitely not sufficient for the size of the dish and the salsas that accompanied it lacked flavour altogether.

Overall we unfortunately had a bad experience even though I really wanted to love it. The majority of the servers and staff belittled us and had no interest in recovering from our negative experience and made us feel like our opinions were unjustified.

Service was excellent. Food was good but not amazing or memorable. The lamb enchiladas was definitely the best of all the dishes we had (we also ordered the mushrooms, the duck breast with tortillas added and the octopus). The dessert (coconut meringue) was the next best dish of the night. I would recommend for the experience/atmosphere for a nice romantic date night but wouldn't come back just for the food.\n\\\n\"We went to Quetzal to celebrate our anniversary; I was looking for a restaurant that would give us delicious food that was unique in an atmosphere that was unpretentious, and Quetzal delivered!\\\n\\\nThe tasting menu starts at about $100 per person, which can vary slightly if you have specific preferences for items on the menu.

The way every cocktail, every dish, every bite, expanded my palette and excited me in new ways makes Quetzal worthy of every award and designation it's received. I can't recommend it enough.\n\\\nSo happy to have tried this place. Service was great - they were very attentive, and the food and drinks were lovely. It was a special evening with a friend on a short visit from Vancouver, and this place did not disappoint. We got chef's choice and just requested to include the bone marrow and shrimp (definitely recommend) but we were happy with everything we were served (least favorite was the amberjack aguachile).

Highly recommended\"\n\\\nOutstanding meal. Standout dishes were the amberjack aguachile, mushrooms, and pork secreto. The masa dishes were also superb, and the accompanying salsas complemented each dish perfectly. Service was excellent. Mezcal flight to finish teleported you right back to Oaxaca.

Sweet potato cooked on charcoal...SOOOO good.  Nice dumbed down education on Mezcal was fun. Wish I could get a reservation easier but I'm happy that they are always busy. That way they can keep bringing in new and interesting bar and food items.\n\\\nOne of my favourite places in Toronto!! Everything was outstanding.

Every dish has character and depth without coming off as pretentious; which can often be the case whenever restaurants seek to offer an elevated dining experience. Many upscale restaurants rely on gimmicks such as \\'91deconstructed\\'92 dishes where everything is a mousse or a foam for absolutely no good reason.\\\n\\\nThe narrow space and open kitchen create a cozy atmosphere that is well-suited for romantic occasions, while the wood-burning grill fills the space with a pleasant and subtle smokey/earthy aroma. The ambiance was further enhanced by my date, as the warm ochrous lighting augmented her beauty. Spools of her bistre-brown hair plunged around her delicate face and hid a swan\\'92s neck as I stuffed my face with large Argentinian shrimps and drops of glazed bone marrow ran down my oaken jaw.\\\n\\\nUnsurprisingly, the service was impeccable; staff was highly attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive. Quetzal will give you a newfound appreciation for the complexity of Mexican cuisine.\"\n\\\nOur first Michelin star experience. They know their flavours clearly. We ordered a bunch of dishes but the mushrooms were the highlight. Scallops were fresh and tasty. Lamb empanada was good. The pork was succulent. Pleasantly surprised by the spiced Mexican dessert - a must try. Parking is usually available on one of the streets across.\n\\\nFirst time eating at a Michelin 1 star, loved the lamb, when i bite into the fat i can only taste happiness. It is the feel of hot fat melting in my mouth and making my tastebuds feel happy. Definately coming back for more.\n\\\nService was amazing. I would say that the food was really good. We ordered the tasting menu plus few extra items. Furthermore, the atmosphere and place was outstanding. Turisteaconawi.blogspot\n\\\nAn excellent dining experience. Very high attention to detail, and the food was simply amazing. It's not anything you'd find on the streets of Mexico but they take all those flavors and elevate them into a familiar tasting fine dining experience.  I can't wait to go back.\n\\\nHuge shout out to chef Cathrine and others for providing an warm and friendly dining experience filled with perfect food, atmosphere and service. Money we\\'92ll spent, I will be back whenever I\\'92m visiting Toronto.\n\\\nOn a quest to dine at all the Michelin Star restaurants on Toronto! This was the second place to visit on the list.

However, the level of attention from staff dropped off after our main server/bartender left. They offer both a tasting menu and a la carte options, which is a nice touch. I tried a variety of dishes including scallop ceviche, octopus, empanada, tlayuda bone marrow/shrimps, and almond cake. The ceviche was my favorite dish, but I didn't enjoy the octopus or bone marrow as they had a burnt taste. The portion sizes were generous and can easily be shared by two people. Prices are reasonable for downtown Toronto. The presentation is a bit rustic. The cocktails are typical mezcal/tequila cocktails commonly served at modern Mexican restaurants. I've been to better Mexican restaurants in Toronto with more flavorful options. Additionally, the restroom could use some attention as toilet paper was missing from one of the stalls. Overall, I would recommend this place to those who are curious to try new restaurants, but if you're looking for more flavorful options, there are better Mexican/fusion fine dining places on King St for around the same price.\n\\\nFabulous restaurant with a super fun vibe! Would definitely recommend the tasting menu. Great service. Cocktails were delicious also!\n\\\nOver the top service and delicious food!

I would totally recommend this restaurant, but compared to the last two Michelin Star restaurants I've eaten at, one in Spain the other in Italy, it's not on the same level.  Those restaurants took me on a culinary journey that blew me away.   Didn't get that at Quetzal.   With that being said, you won't be disappointed with the food here.

The atmosphere, the service, and of course the food were all amazing!\n\\\nThere is a reason this place has a Michelin star!  From the moment we stepped into the place the service was fabulous!  Matthew, one of our servers or jack of all trades as we called him, was amazing as was the rest of the staff! We had the tasting menu and every dish was better than the last one and the wines recommended were excellent.  We had a wonderful experience!\n\\\nIncredible experience, meal and cocktails. Excellent presentation and professionalism. Wine pairing is a must. Happily accommodating for a shrimp and nut allergy.\n\\\nQuetzal was one of the best experiences. There was not one bad thing on the menu and the service was amazing. They even brought out a surprise dessert and two glasses of champagne when we told them it was our anniversary dinner. The best part was the flavour of the food. 10/10 would recommend.\n\\\nService was phenomenal! Sat at the bar and felt like home... Very informative, accommodating and super friendly.  Drinks were ridiculously good too... Da bomb ting\n\\\nSupreme quality of meat and a beautiful interior. I can\\'92t stop thinking about their potato salad and lamb masa.\n\\\nThis place is legit. I was skeptical going in because I\\'92m not typically a fan of fancy Mexican food, as it can often lack flavour\\'85 but they do it extremely well here. I\\'92ll definitely be back.\n\\\nThat Michelin star was well-earned.\n\\\nAbsolutely amazing. Food and drinks were truly phenomenal, and quality service from Wyatt and the bar team. Highly recommend the tasting menu where they select the dishes for you based on your preferences. Definitely check this place out!}", "doc_id": "f2966861-611e-43ec-9f57-31752746457f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "10751afd351306af5f8b406730b7bbd6c4bc003c418abd222fc27f20a79cd082", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 134629, "end": 136521}, "relationships": {"1": "223c0bf5-1f3f-4b1e-99c0-299baea9bed8", "2": "2985ee31-5129-4e80-8ae3-58f21c1b5e35"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
