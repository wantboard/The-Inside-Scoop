right. \\'a0They said tax was included in total but not written down. \\'a0They then auto added approx 20 CAD for service charge for small group of 3 people (I would give them more than that myself if they did not auto charge me lol)...my bill ended up approx 200 CAD...and I did not receive a receipt with my change...food was ok..very good for pics...service was good..it would be much better if they are straight forward about tax and service charge...we were on vacation so I did not want to make a big deal and be upset about it ..but not recommending\n\\\nIf I were in death row, this would bet final meal. The seafood was so insanely fresh. They literally bring you the shellfish for you to see with the weight for you to inspect before it gets cooked. Lunch was insanely delicious. The service was amazing. The place is perfect. I cannot wait to travel back north just to experience this again.\n\\\nExtremely expensive for what it has to offer .. Lobster and crap are really good there but for me this doesn&#39;t justify the price! Service is horrible and waitress don&#39;t listen or respond at all ... Other stores can do these above items and are much less expensive. Ambiance is good again not super.\n\\\nDefinitely \\'a0worth the price, in my opinion. I&#39;ve dined in the restaurant and had takeout and both were great experiences. A seafood lovers paradise, that&#39;s for sure.\n\\\nFor a mouthwatering lobster meal, look no further.

I am from California and this is the first time I ever saw a huge restaurant with tanks full of king crabs and lobsters.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the seafood is fresh and delicious but i don&#39;t know if they can chopped it off and deep fried than cook it again in that times. I recommended you go to the kitchen and see with your own eye when they chop up those seafoods. <br>The restaurant was clean and huge.. definitely worth the price!\n\\\nIf you&#39;re a fan of seafood, you absolutely have to try this place! I recently had the pleasure of dining here and I have to say, it was an incredible experience.<br><br>First of all, the lobster was out of this world. It was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. The freshness and quality of the seafood were evident in every bite. Also, The different combo deals they offer were very reasonably priced, especially considering the amount of food you get.<br><br>The restaurant itself is clean and well-maintained, which is always a plus.<br><br>However, the only downside is that they ONLY accept cash payments, please get some cash if you are traveling. While this may be an inconvenience for some, it&#39;s worth it for the incredible food and experience you&#39;ll have here.<br><br>One tip I would give is to make sure you book ahead of time, as this place is very popular and can get quite busy. But trust me, it&#39;s worth it. The service is top-notch, and the food is simply amazing.<br><br>Overall, I recommend Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant to anyone who loves seafood. The lobster alone is reason enough to come here, but the other dishes are just as delicious. Don&#39;t miss out on this amazing dining experience!\n\\\nWe had an extremely terrible experience at this place. No customer should ever be treated like how we were treated!<br><br>We did bring up these issues (listed below) to the manager. The male manager did try to resolve these issues by offering us a vip card, BUT WE DID NOT ACCEPT. It&#39;s not about the &#34;vip&#34; it&#39;s about how we were treated as customers. The amount of food we order, the prices wasn&#39;t cheap either. We have 4 very young kids that we have to fed before we can even start eating ourselves. The fact that the female waitresses bad mouth us in front of us, thinking that we didn&#39;t understand was wrong already.

We kindly ask if she can pack our dessert since we didn&#39;t even finish eating, and our dessert was not touch. The waitresses said &#34;oh you want that too?&#34; \\'a0(WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THIS?!?!) My friend said yes, we didn&#39;t finish eating our dinner, and you guys are rushing us. You took all our plates so we couldn&#39;t eat anymore. The female waitresses reply &#34;oh the other waitresses said you guys were done eating. She kept on pushing the blame to another waitress.\n\\\nGreat Great restaurant. Easily one of my Favorite. Good service. Good ambiance and REALLY good food.\n\\\nThe restaurant is different from all others. They have fish tanks surrounding the seating area. Each of the tank has lobsters or King Crabs in it. This typical seafood family Chinese restaurant is always busy during dinner time, even today, on a regular weekday. So be sure to make reservation. I personally think the food in this reataurant is over rated. The taste was not as &#34;wow&#34; as I thought. The presentation is definitely an excitement experience but the taste is below my expectation. So, it is def recommended to eat here for the experience. The ambiance in this restaurant is definitely very commercialy interesting. <br>PS; prepare extra cash since they only accept cash and they always &#34;bumped&#34; the price \\'a0at least $200-300. They said the smallest king crab is 9lb so u have to pay 4lb extra at $65-70/lbs. No worry, no surprises, they will let u know ahead of time of ur total bill.\n\\\nSo with all the hype this was on our must try list, ordered the #10 combo, came with 8lb lobster and 2 crabs. We did the crab in HK garlic style, which was not that authentic, they used some chili along with Maggie sauce with French fries instead of all garlic flakes. The crabs were with salted egg yolk flavor which was really good. Service was good, waiter did not try to upsell us.

The service was wonderful, and fast, they even packed our takeout for us. <br><br>We had the second combo I think, with 4 lbs of lobster, the bass and the veggies. But they restaurant was lovely and substituted the lobster rice for us becuase we don&#39;t eat pork. This was a delicious substitution. The dessert was jello, which was much better than their sesame soup they used to give. The fries on our lobster mountain were a little stale, but other than that we absolutely enjoyed this meal and the experience\n\\\nThe term prix fixe menu means a multi-course meal for a fixed price, but definitely not the case here! \\'a0Please be prepare to pay at least 50%~75% extra, if not more! \\'a0Though the prix fixe menu stated a 8-lb King Crab, they will tell you that the smallest one they have is almost 10 lbs, so you will have to pay roughly $150 more! \\'a0Without a doubt the same applied to the listed 8-lb \\'a0lobster! \\'a0What can you say when everyone has already sat down and settled, especially if you have guests with you! \\'a0A prix fixe of $1,088 came out to almost $2,000. \\'a0 Just google and you&#39;ll easily find similar stories for the past 10 years! \\'a0Top that, we were paying for MSG quality food, and 2-star restaurant service. \\'a0Then again, you might not believe me til you walk in my shoes, good luck!\n\\\nTons of reviews so not a lot to add<br>The lobster and king crab is truly amazing <br>It&#39;s a great place to entertain guests <br>Place is known internationally with star sightings <br>It&#39;s a very busy place even though the prices are incredibly outrageous and they upsell you on every item<br>Customer service is lacking given the $$$$ being spent here\n\\\nI love this place...service and seafood was amazing. Be sure to make a reservation before you go. They get very busy. There are live lobster and king crabs in tanks all over the restaurant for display. They will weigh your seafood and let you know if there are any additional charges. There are quite a few family meals to choose from..it&#39;s just a matter of how much food you like and how you&#39;d like it cooked.

So make sure to plan ahead, especially if you are buying one of the lobster mountain specials, etc which run $700++. <br><br>My group of friends were visiting Toronto and we made a reservation in advance, since we knew we wanted to dine here and have our Lobster mountain experience. It did not disappoint!! We ordered the lobster and snow crab mountain dinner for 6-8 people and it was plenty of food. You get to take pictures with the live lobster and snow crab before they are cooked, so it is quite the experience and perfect for social media pics. <br><br>The meal itself was absolutely delicious. We feasted on soup, snow pea tips, fried bass, steamed king crab, and of course our lobster mountain cooked Hong Kong style. The meal also came with a bottle of white wine and lychee dessert. We are so much food, I couldn&#39;t even think about eating for 48 hours afterward. It was a fun group experience, and worth the price!!\n\\\nThey are too expensive. Each waitress give different information and explanations. Fried rice is below average.\n\\\nThe restaurant was known for it&#39;s lobster mountains, but it changed a long time ago which pushed into what it&#39;s known for now. It is now covered with soggy fries as it&#39;s base, which from a long long time ago, before it was relocated, it was covered with fried garlic and fried little fishes, that was the time it tastes way better than now.<br><br>It loses its original. And now it&#39;s just not what it was. And thus not worth a try, just for pictures only.\n\\\nWhere to start off....<br><br>The service is amazing. The staff is extremely communicative and observative. They are very transparent with everything. We felt like we were treated as VIPs. We came in the night of the storm and the place is still really busy. I would think on a regular nice day, you would need to make reservations days in advance. <br><br>Once you place your order, they bring the catches alive to your table. They let you know how much they weigh....all set combos have a set price however, obviously catches are not exact in lbs, and you will usually end up with a catch thats heavier than you anticipated, as a result you will be paying extra. We ordered the King Crab and Lobster dinner for 4, and paid $26 extra for extra weight. After you see your catches, they cook it straight away and the dishes are brought to you very very fast. <br><br>Before I begin with the review of the food, I do not enjoy seafood, so the food were not to my palette. But this was a treat to my parents who are big seafood lovers and reviews are written from their reactions and responses to the food. <br><br>We started with a daily special soup, this one was a fu mu gi/silkie chicken soup.

The chicken was very tender and flavorful. <br><br>Soon after, our 3lb lobster tower cooked Hong Kong style came. It was covered in french fries, which was a interesting garnish however they were amazing with the seasoning and fried onions (i believe). A big gamble with seafood restaurants is if the seafood is mostly shell or mostly meat. And this was most definately full of meat. The seasoning had a slight sweet spicy to it which is perfect. The meat was super tender and overall amazing. <br><br>Then came our king crab leg jenga! and then the steamed king crab with egg white came too. Both amazing dishes. The fried crab leg was so full of sauce and seasoning, and so flavorful and tender. The meat was practicially slipping apart like pulled pork. The legs were also just so full of meat. But with this kind of price, this is what you want to expect. The steamed king crab was a great yinyang balance. The flavor was subtle but so rich at the same time. And the egg white made everything melt in your melt. <br><br>Next came the crab fried rice and it tastes great. Comfort food to the max. Tastes like the hearty yangzhou fried rice we all know and love with a little bit of bougee and bedazzle from the crab shell. <br><br>The servings of our seafood dishes came to an end, and a dish of leafy vegetables and goji berries were served, to balance all the protein haha. Very flavorful and well cooked and fresh. And not so oily. <br><br>Finally, our dessert was served. This dish was not so large, just a few pieces of ginger jello. Definately an interesting taste , but a great palette cleanser. <br><br>Overall the meal is amazing and a whole experience. If you are a seafood lover, you should definately splurge on a meal like this if you get the chance to. The bigger the party, the more you get out of your money. Our combo was meant for 4 people, and we had plenty of leftovers for the 3 of us as well considering I did not much of the lobster or crab. A waitress kindly assisted us in packing the food into takeout containers. <br><br>The meal for 3 totalled to $667. Very pricey but it is understandable due to the market price of seafood nowadays. I believe the price per lbs this restaurant offers is extremely fair (a pound of frozen crab legs at Costco would be minimum $50/lb) A mandatory tip of 12% is added onto your bill FYI. <br><br>Obviously with the price I was about to spend and the larger bills others have, you are seriously hoping not to be let down.

Unless you shit dollar bills, go to Red Lobster and pig out for ways under $100. Do yourself a favour, pass on this money grab.\n\\\nA restaurant where you could have legit Cantonese-style seafood. Big portion with affordable price if you come with friends. <br>Lobsters and king crabs were lively fresh. They were swimming in the pool before cooked. You could choose how you would like the lobsters to be cooked, steamed, deep fried, or cooked with fried rice. <br>The daily soup was also one classic item that you must try, but make sure you leave the chicken alone, drinking the soup without eating the chicken is the Cantonese way to enjoy.\n\\\nDim sum and seafood is good, the environment is fancy. And the price I think is reasonable.\n\\\nCame here on Christmas day and was pretty disappointed with the overall meal experience.<br><br>We were a group of 4 and they only had meal combos starting at $500 for much larger groups. Apparently a few days prior they had combos for 4 but they decided not to offer them on Christmas day. We asked them about it and they said it&#39;s so the kitchen could focus on filling the orders properly for the larger meal combos. That felt disingenuine as the restaurant was only 1/4 or less full the entire night. Probably 6 tables max. Something felt off when it was so dead inside on a holiday. They absolutely could have done the other combos. As a result, we had no choice but to order a la carte with hiked up pricing. (We were going to leave and go next door to Mr Congee but they were packed).<br><br>Peking duck 2 ways was $88 - honestly the skin wasn&#39;t crispy and the duck was sliced so thick it felt like we were eating roast duck. Was not good. Wrap was nice and thin though.<br><br>The free soup was so overly salty none of us could drink it and they had to take it back. <br><br>The other dishes were all fine. Sweet and sour pork was done nicely. The dessert was good too (sweet soup type dessert with tapioca and grains).<br><br>The servers who came by during the meal to switch plates and refill tea were super attentive and the only pleasant part of the meal.<br><br>The price tag for the 4 dishes did not match the quality of the food (specifically the peking duck to be fair).<br><br>Overall quality and consistency is clearly an issue.

It will take plenty of patience to get a table without selling your soul, and the appetite of a demon to finish the literal crustacean mountain. Put on those gloves and forget about your etiquette; this feast is messy, greasy, and very flavorful. And, yes, all the legends are true.\n\\\nThe food is alright but really well presented. It is on the pricier side. Service was alright nothing special.

They come by the table to show you the live crab and lobster so you can... inspect them? Admire them? It was a bit morbid but I can see the appeal.<br><br>My parents are actually vegetarian but the restaurant did their best to accommodate - mostly by removing chicken from the soup that was part of the set meal. Otherwise, my parents just ate rice and stir fry vegetables (eg gai lan). I won&#39;t knock them on this since they never imply being a vegetarian friendly restaurant and we knew the risk coming in.<br><br>The dishes ultimately came out looking really good - the shells were pre-cracked/opened and it was easy to eat. We also had lobster fried rice and some fish dish that were also very good but the stars of the show were definitely the crab and lobster.<br><br>Fishman Lobster Clubhouse lives up to the hype but they&#39;re very pricey - it&#39;s easy to come out of the meal thinking it wasn&#39;t worth it. That said, the food and service were great, so whether it&#39;s worth it really depends on your personal preference.

Everything was delicious, but the standout items were the Crab in Maggie Sauce and Steamed Fish. Hell, even the basic Snow Peas with Fried Garlic was done well.

There&#39;s an entire wall of them, and unlike their lobster cousins, they love to stare you dead on.....with their long, bumpy legs.....like giant, hard-shelled spiders....*shudder*\n\\\nSeptember 25, 2022 - Went here for dinner with 3 other friends, this is definitely my favourite lobster place! <br><br>We ordered #3 Double Lobster Dinner <br>I&#39;m not really a fan of the Salted Egg Yolk Lobster, but the HK Style Lobster was my favourite! The fries were so good too. Service is fast, staff is very quick to help clear messy plates and give you a new one if needed. <br><br>Definitely going back again for the HK Style lobster\n\\\nThey stack the seafood up high for good pictures, but prices are very high.

More than enough food for the 3 of us and still had leftovers!\n\\\nIt&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve heard about this place and it wasn&#39;t until this past month where I finally tried it. I also saw and read that it&#39;s Simu&#39;s favorite restaurant. <br><br>I would call ahead to make reservations because it fills up fast.

Once I walked in, I was super hungry to get started on eating some king crabs because I didn&#39;t eat all day after landing. I decided to take my mom here after our day trip to Niagara Falls right after landing in Toronto and boy we were starving.<br><br>We came here around 4pm for an extremely early dinner hoping it would be less packed and possible empty because who eats dinner that early? As it turns out, we were not the only ones there and as we waited to be seated, more and more people showed up to the restaurant.

Both of us really enjoyed the Deep Fried Legs w/ Salted Egg Yolk and the Steamed Crab Body. The dish with the salted egg yolk was quite tasty and I was craving a bowl of rice to go with it but I tried to avoid it since we both had to finish all this crab by ourselves. The steamed crab body was like any typical steamed dish, nothing too spectacular and we were happy it came out steaming hot unlike certain spots where it comes out lukewarm.<br><br>The Fried Small Leg in HK Style dish was kinda weird to us, since we both have eaten and lived in HK and we&#39;ve never eaten a king crab dish that was served with fries. Didn&#39;t want to eat the fries but only the crab legs. The last two dishes, Fried Rice in Crab Shell (very bland) and Poach Snow Pea Tips with Goji Berry (came out lukewarm) underperformed in quality. The fried rice I make at home would&#39;ve tasted better than the one they served. Honestly it was the presentation that looked great but tasted mediocre. And as I said earlier, the snow pea tips came out cold and we didn&#39;t want to complain so we just ate it. <br><br>Overall, as a first time visitor to Toronto, we still enjoyed eating here but probably not the price we paid. We&#39;ve eaten cheaper king crab meals in Hong Kong for half the price and double the size; our crab was almost 6 pounds. However, it was an experience to visit during our time in Toronto and glad we starved ourselves the entire day before eating this meal. Would definitely come back again and try out the lobsters because we noticed a lot of tables order lobster compared to their crab.\n\\\nBest Chinese cuisine in Scarborough. Lobster is fresh and portions are huge. Other dishes are great as well.\n\\\nWow!! There is nothing I could compare this place with. If you are a seafood lover, you will be in heaven. The place is big and bright and staff walking around to help. When you are there close to dinner time, there is a 2 hr time limit. As they are trying to get as many people in and out. It makes it a little hard to enjoy the food more. But it can be done. <br><br>We ordered a 10.3 lobster and some pea pod leaves for veggies. They brought the lobster over to show and allow to hold and take pics. They will tell you the price before they take it into the kitchen to cook. <br><br>We ordered it HK style. It came out in a tower and had some French fries. Different but it had good seasoning. The lobster pieces were breaded a little and had good flavor.<br><br>There are so many tanks filled with lobsters, Dungeness crab and king crab. Next trip will have to try a crab.

You don&#39;t need to worry about that there, they will show you the live ingredients, like lobsters, to you and tell you the price beforehand.<br><br>The dishes were tasty. You should come to enjoy it if you like Cantonese-style seafood dishes.\n\\\nThis place has become somewhat of a cultural phenomenon, famous for serving up towers of lobster and crabs. Surprisingly one of my favourite dish there is not a seafood dish, but the sweet and sour pork. Nonetheless, the seafood is also solid and would recommend for a special occasion.<br><br>HK style lobster - The spicy garlic flavour on the lobster was tasty! Served on a bed of fries to soak in the same galicy flavour. Pieces were cut nicely so that all the meat on the lobster was accessible.<br><br>Scallion + green onion king crab - A more subtle flavour than the hk style to highlight the natural sweetness of crab meat. King crab is rather pricey and would only recommend to try. <br><br>Sweet and sour pork - So. Good. Crispy shell remains crispy even after the application of the sweet and sour sauce. The meat has both meaty and fatty components giving bites of deliciousness. The meat wasn&#39;t drenched in sauce either so not overpowering the fried pork. Always look forward to this when I come here. <br><br>Lobster fried rice - This was nothing special. A good carrier for the sauces and flavours coming from the seafood.\n\\\nA fun dinning experience for seafood lovers. Nice bright restaurant with live seafood tanks that wrap around the whole restaurant. They bring out the lobster before cooking perfect for all your social media feeds. Lobster was delicious and service is pretty good as they keep changing plates for you as it fills up from all the seafood shells. Very much on the pricey side but a great experience.\n\\\nDelicious! Would be five stars is a bit cheaper. Highlight was the lobster tower HK style. As noted in other reviews, will push you to order a larger size, so order a few pound under what you actually want. The steamed crab in wine was just okay - would recommend the lobster instead. The fish was an unexpected highlight - sweet, silky, and perfectly cooked.\n\\\n\\uc0\\u21018 \\u21018 \\u21507 \\u36807 \\u24863 \\u35273 \\u24456 \\u19981 \\u22909 \\u65292 \\u26377 \\u31181 \\u33457 \\u22823 \\u20215 \\u38065 \\u21507 \\u27969 \\u27700 \\u24109 \\u30340 \\u24863 \\u35273 \\u65292 \\u25226 \\u26114 \\u36149 \\u30340 \\u30340 \\u28023 \\u40092 \\u20570 \\u25104 \\u20102 \\u24555 \\u39184 \\u33539 \\u65292 \\u38750 \\u24120 \\u19981 \\u20540 \\u65292 \\u19981 \\u20250 \\u20877 \\u27425 \\u20809 \\u39038 <br>Very bad experience, they made the expensive seafood into a fast", "doc_id": "b0c18629-71e2-4a1f-98b3-a929438773ba", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2430b5bf0c89a410a6ee2d8a90e2d58bf843a25807e0c944f0cd3f2a47603106", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 42430, "end": 45729}, "relationships": {"1": "7269b0e4-1ae5-420a-98c5-3fde650b87c0", "2": "737d76ac-d231-4cac-8d1d-ef6834f98088", "3": "72f8fe38-5762-4afe-b18a-08e47f553357"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "72f8fe38-5762-4afe-b18a-08e47f553357": {"__data__": {"text": "\\u24863 \\u35273 \\u24456 \\u19981 \\u22909 \\u65292 \\u26377 \\u31181 \\u33457 \\u22823 \\u20215 \\u38065 \\u21507 \\u27969 \\u27700 \\u24109 \\u30340 \\u24863 \\u35273 \\u65292 \\u25226 \\u26114 \\u36149 \\u30340 \\u30340 \\u28023 \\u40092 \\u20570 \\u25104 \\u20102 \\u24555 \\u39184 \\u33539 \\u65292 \\u38750 \\u24120 \\u19981 \\u20540 \\u65292 \\u19981 \\u20250 \\u20877 \\u27425 \\u20809 \\u39038 <br>Very bad experience, they made the expensive seafood into a fast food taste.

It&#39;s true what they say, the bigger the lobster, the tougher the meat. might go for smaller lobsters next time.\n\\\nWe were in food Heaven with the amazing food here. \\'a0We eat out all the time and travel all over and this is likely the best meals we ever had in our lives. We ordered a package which included 6 lbs king crab with twin lobsters totaling over 4 lbs. We have eaten fresh king crab from the tank many amazing times but this version tops all of them. \\'a0The lobsters with Maggie sauce were amazing as well. \\'a0 I kept sucking the shells along with the meat because the flavor was incredible. My wife especially loved the steamed bass. \\'a0The cubed steak was so tender and delicious as well. \\'a0 My daughter especially loved the snow pea tips. \\'a0 All I can say is wow. Wow. Wow. You can&#39;t leave Toronto without visiting this amazing restaurant.\n\\\nGood food , decent service <br>Only challenge is that you have to remember to bring cash\n\\\nThis is definitely one of the best seafood restaurant in Toronto. Top in Canada actually! I&#39;m so happy that I don&#39;t need to fly to Vancouver for this :)\n\\\nWent there for lunch. Got a typhoon lobster, steamed fish, garlic diced beef and fried rice.<br><br>The lobster was huge but no longer active. The seasoning was perfect. And the addition of fried is innovative and surprisingly worked well. However the lobster meat tasted rubbery. Not sure if this was due to overcooking or they swapped the live lobster with a long dead one. And since lobster was supposed to be the star of the combo. This is a terrible failure.<br><br>The garlic beef and fried rice were done perfectly and tasted amazing. otherwise I would have rated it 2 stars. Fish was also slightly overcooked.\n\\\nReally cool experience I got to try while visiting Canada. It is very expensive but I think the experience is worth it. First you get to choose your course meal and I highly suggest doing the fried lobster because the way the fry it plus the huge amount of fried garlic and umami flavor punch is so good! I thought the steamed dishes were just okay but the mountain fried one with the fries was so good. You do have to order a certain amount of pounds so you will need a group of people. Also I hear the smaller lobsters taste better then getting a big lobster but the big lobster is fun to take pictures with so I guess you need to choose there what is more important to you (experience and photo or taste).\n\\\nOh.

Many other places do it better with a shorter wait time. Just an average experience.\n\\\nYou see this on food channels for their huge stacked lobsters. Reading the reviews we did look at the a la carte menu, and chose what we wanted. Then we saw exactly what we wanted on a set menu which was well priced. We loved everything.\n\\\nFishman Lobster has firmly cemented itself as a tourist / foodie destination. I&#39;ve seen it pop up on several Youtube channels now and honestly, well deserved. Great place to have in York region and this place is always bustling. <br><br>Having said that, be prepared to pay that brand premium. The prices aren&#39;t too outrageous given the amount of seafood, but it&#39;s definitely still on the higher end of things, especially if you get the stuff that&#39;s good for pictures: giant lobster towers, king crabs, etc. Definitely a special occasion kinda thing. <br><br>The most famous is of course the giant lobster towers. They deep fry their lobster and crab in copious amounts of garlic and stack them up high. Like a tasty crustacean Jenga tower. They then give you gloves so that you can eat with your hands. Ironically, I don&#39;t much care for their fried lobster. I find that it&#39;s fried with too much flour, but the rest of my friends love it. I prefer the crab, and usually I find the other menu items more to my liking (honey garlic oysters, tender stir fried beef, etc.) <br><br>If you like tasty food and eating with your hands, this is your kinda place. Get the lobster tower (for the experience), skip the king crab (you can get regular crab combo for a fraction of the price unless you want a picture of yourself holding a spiky sea spider), and look forward to a good time.\n\\\nPro-tip: They are a cash only or Canadian debit card only establishment but there&#39;s an ATM at the gas station next door. <br><br>Highlights: It is really impressive how they offer lobster mountains and they do a good job with cooking it as well. Since mostly everyone orders set menus, the food comes out crazy fast. They recommend HK style for their lobster which apparently is fried and served with french fries but I prefer my lobster steamed so I would want to try that next time. <br><br>Lowlights: The set menus are definitely a better deal, but if you&#39;re only interested in the lobster, they don&#39;t make it very cost effective. The sweet and sour pork was terrible because every single piece was all fat and not meat.\n\\\nOne of the best seafood experience I&#39;ve had in recent years. <br><br>First of all, it&#39;s pretty expensive but if you love seafood, it&#39;s worth it. <br><br>Second of all, do the combo. <br><br>Third of all, if you can&#39;t decide between lobster or king crab.

Been here twice. First time was in old location. This time in current location. We had a party of 20, 2 tables. Food is good. Didn&#39;t think it was spectacular like the first time we been here. Lobster and king crab was over cooked/ fried, it was their recommendation. They used to have nicer finishes around the lobster and crab. Now it&#39;s French fries. Other food is good. I don&#39;t think $2400 good. (That is correct $2400 for 2 tables) We we&#39;re deciding the dinner menu and was wondering to pick dishes a La carte or getting a dinner suit. Lady couldn&#39;t take a clue to move back and let us decide. After 4 attempts to ask nicely, we have to tell her firmly to give us some time. She huffed off. There is huge upsale as their lobster and crab is always over the weight of the set price. We asked them to change the critters to be closer to exact weight and they refused. We were ok even if it was a little less. No. Rude.<br>Service was nothing special. Typical rude Chinese restaurant. <br>Tip: You will need a substantial amount of cash to dine here. They only take that and local Canadian debit card. We&#39;re from the US. <br>The good news is they are upfront about it. <br>Another bad is you need to place a hefty deposit of $200 for our tables. And you have a dining time limit so they will chase you out when your 2 hours is up. <br>Most likely the last time dining here.<br>Visually their seafood towers are unique, didn&#39;t say delicious.

When you sit at the table being surrounded by water tanks on all sides with live crabs and lobsters inside, It makes you wonder the lobsters must be petrified watching us eat them...\n\\\nPricy but very good seafood meal but the salad plate was old, don&#39;t know how could they have serve client with that\n\\\nThis is our number 1 place on our bucket lists to eat for our vacation traveling from Houston to Toronto. \\'a0We were so hyped about this place since we watched the video from strictly dumpling and other YouTube reviews. \\'a0The king crab and lobsters were delicious as we are expecting but the fried rice makes me want to throw up because of the roach(es). \\'a0Worst is this roach is from the 1st spoon of fried rice. \\'a0 We called the managers ( the ball headed guy in pink shirt and the other guy in blue shirt in the picture) and they gives me all kinds of excuses ( roaches are from outside flying to the kitchen while cooking, blah blah blah). \\'a0Yes, coach roach can fly but not this small in-house roach. \\'a0This is our first scoop of fried rice, imagine how many more in the plate. \\'a0 He, manager in blue, told me that they will cook another fried rice for me, but I lost my appetite and want to throw up. \\'a0 He than said that they will offer 10% off. \\'a0I told him no. \\'a0He then talked to the other manager, bald head in pink shirt, stopped at my table and said that they will give me 5%. \\'a0 I told him that he must be joking and he said that maximum is 20%. \\'a0 I don&#39;t take that offer and he said he doesn&#39;t care. \\'a0I told him that I rather pay for the full price and I will warn peoples regarding to how unsanitary and uncaring for the customer. \\'a0I did pay for the full price of the meal and we didn&#39;t eat the remainders of the whole meal.\n\\\nWOW this place is a MUST VISIT when you&#39;re in the area. but be warned, you need to have a lot of people in your party when you visit because the portions are HUGE. i&#39;m not exactly sure what we ordered but i think we ordered their meal for 10-12 people and there was enough leftovers for everyone to serve themselves a second meal. I was so impressed with everything that they put on our table and could not stop eating. the waiters and waitresses make sure you are taken care of and the chefs are doing such an amazing job with the meals.\n\\\nWow! What an amazing feast to share with the family! We got the 10-12 people combo meal which cost about $899 CAD, including some wine, tax and tip, the whole meal cost us over $1100 CAD.

Also, please accept credit payments.\n\\\nWe ordered the higher end meal. The soup came very very salty and when advising to the manager nothing was done about it. The overall meal wasn&#39;t worth the price tag. I would suggest going with smaller combos and add up.\n\\\n*ALERT THIS PLACE IS CASH OR CANADIAN DEBIT CARD ONLY*<br><br>I was surprised too because they&#39;re such a large restaurant and expect people to carry this much cash on hand. \\'a0But other than that complaint, the food was really good!!!<br><br>I&#39;m generally not a lobster / crab person since I don&#39;t know how to peel it or eat it but they make it sooo easy for you here so I really appreciate that.

But, the food was good. The dinner included lobster, King crab, abalone, and veggie. The King&#39;s crab meat was very tender and flavorful. The only lobster mountain is magnificent too. We are so full and didn&#39;t finish all of the dishes. It also has lobster fried rice which was very good too. How I wish we have this type of restaurant in LA.\n\\\nWent there for my birthday with my family of 5 and another family. Definitely lived up to the hype.

The restaurant ONLY accept cash or Canadian debit card. We were unable to pay with our debit card since we were from the States. Luckily a gentleman at the table next to us were nice enough to pay and we PayPal him. I really don&#39;t understand how such a big restaurant didn&#39;t accept any other forms of payments. That was really inconvenient. The waitress just kept saying it&#39;s on the menu and we should&#39;ve seen it. SMH <br><br>Other than that, food was good.\n\\\nBEWARE: They always upsell you on the weight of the lobster and king crab. They always claim that they don&#39;t have ones that weigh less, however they have walls and walls of lobsters and crab. There&#39;s no way that they don&#39;t have one that&#39;s approximately the same weight as the one you request. Also, don&#39;t advertise that the set menu is for a 7lbs king crab for $899 if you don&#39;t have that. You should put a disclaimer that the weight and price may be more than advertised. Very deceiving. Stick to your guns if you want to stick with your requested weight. They will ALWAYS upsell you.\n\\\nLove it. Very good prices for a lot of lobster. They bring out the lobster to you and you can take a picture with it before it gets cooked xD. I suppose that proves that it&#39;s fresh! It tastes great :)\n\\\nAs good as I remembered but I did notice they skimped on a few items. The lobsters are no longer made with little fish. They subbed it with fries. But still overall - an impressive, memorable meal.\n\\\nThis is my 5th time going here. We brought friends from \\'a0the US and raved about the food. The food is really good. The sweet and sour pork is my favourite as well as the seafood but this time it had alot of pieces that were just pork fat. It was disappointing.<br>However, the 2* rating is for the poor service.<br>We wanted a set menu for 10-12 people. We had 10 in our group. We&#39;ve ordered this menu before and ended up with food to take home. This time the server and manager told us the crab that was included in the menu was not available. They wouldn&#39;t let us pay extra for the crab that was available. Instead they only gave us the option to go to a higher priced menu. They were inflexible and had poor customer service. We ended up with a smaller lobster with the higher priced menu. We couldn&#39;t leave as we had visitors with us but if it were just a few of us, I would have walked out. It was the worst customer service I&#39;ve ever had in this restaurant. As a result, I won&#39;t be going back again. Beware as they are now trying to sell higher priced menus!

After years of shows dedicated to it. I&#39;ll finally arrived and I was not disappointed. <br><br>The prices were average and nothing shocking. FX currently favors the USD so it benefited us. <br><br>The menu can be a bit challenging to navigate depending on party size and what you want to eat. The way you want it prepared and how it&#39;s cooked adds another layer of complexity. <br><br>This is what we ordered for 5 <br><br>9lb King Crab but honestly could have done the 11 easily. Prepare it two ways. Maggie and Fried garlic with the fried rice. It was just amazing. The salted egg yolk was good and better than most places but the way it&#39;s cooked here is on another level. <br><br>The 3lb lobster was cookies with Maggie sauce over a bed of veggies and noodles. <br><br>This amount of food was enough for 5. We added another order of sweet and sour spare ribs just to top it off. <br><br>One of the most amazing seafood meals I&#39;ve had.\n\\\nFood was amazing especially the king crabs. We enjoyed and will definitely recommend to everyone.\n\\\nIt&#39;s expensive so definitely not an every week endeavour, but the food is really great. My favourite thing would have to be their oysters and crab legs. This is not to say that their other seafood isn&#39;t good, I just haven&#39;t had the same calibre of oysters and crab legs at other restaurants (vs their lobster which is pretty standard and similar to most other seafood restaurants).\n\\\nAbsolutely amazing we had a family of five and we got the 4 person dinner special. 499 with a king crab and lobster. King crab was served 3 ways. It came with a soup and a side of vegetables. Please note they do add tip on the bill. Also they will ask you if the crab and the lobster size is ok for you before they prepared it. Our total was 659 with tip and taxes. Also note that you have to order the combo. If you order it separately it will be more expensive. <br><br>This is our second time and we absolutely will be coming back!\n\\\nAs Mark Wiens often puts it, &#34;oh wow!&#34; I can understand the hype for this restaurant, which can arguably be considered one of the must-try spots for seafood! Not only are the staff and ambiance of the restaurant amazing, but the food was incredibly fresh and delicious! There are ample amount of space between diners so everyone can enjoy themselves without feeling like they&#39;re on top of each other.

However, it does come with two small bundle of very fresh sharkfin! So worth trying once but it&#39;s not something feasible to eat repeatedly.<br><br>Steamed Vancouver crab with garlic and vermicelli - At 29 dollars per pound, my wife and I were stuffed with a 2.87 pound crab, so gauge yourself accordingly and order a size that won&#39;t be too much for your party. The crab was incredibly fresh and our decision to steam it was due to it allowing us to add-on the 5 dollar vermicelli option, which was then infused with both garlic and crab flavors!! It&#39;s definitely fresh because the crab was incredibly sweet! <br><br>Garlic beef cubes - we asked the waiter if they recommended the sweet and sour pork for 23 dollars or the garlic beef cubes and without hesitation he suggested the latter. Boy, listening to his recommendation was the best decision ever. The beef was cooked PERFECTLY medium rare and the flavor of garlic infused soy sauce coated the steak luxuriously! This was by far my personal favorite! At 25 dollars for a hefty portion, this outshine some other more expensive cuts of steak I had elsewhere. Definitely a must-get and I promise you won&#39;t regret it!! By the way, it also comes with a few strands of veggies as you can see in the picture (: <br><br>Lastly, the snow pea tips with garlic - this was okay, not that flavorful but it was a pretty big portion for less than 20 dollars. We ordered it because we figured we need some fiber and it was decent. \\'a0Probably would try some other veggie next time though.<br><br>Overall, an amazing seafood (and beef) experience! They have tons to offer and it seems like the combo deals are a bigger bang for your buck, but probably more so if you have a larger party. Definitely try this place out at least once, especially if you&#39;re not from Toronto. Can&#39;t wait to come back next time with a bigger group so we can try other delicious items!!

Crab and lobster tanks make up the walls of the restaurant and they bring the massive catch you&#39;ve ordered to the table for a photo op. The prefixed combos give you the best bang for your buck and takes the headache out of making decisions. I&#39;ve been here a handful of times and the salted egg yolk preparation never disappoints. We didn&#39;t want leftovers this time and opted for a la carte ordering instead of a combo. Note the salted egg yolk preparation is an extra $20 for seafood less than 4 lbs and an extra $30 for anything greater than 4 lbs. Also important to note this place only takes CAD, Canadian debit or USD (1:1 conversion). There is no ATM inside the restaurant, but the gas station next door has one. Seafood is undoubtedly the star at this restaurant, but we also ordered the beed tenderloin in black pepper sauce and that was delicious too. The sauce was slightly sweet and meat was extremely tender.\n\\\nOverall experience here was horrible. My friends and I saw that there were a couple pieces of raw crab in our food, but when we notified the managers, they said those prices were hard to cook. Then we found even more raw crab and noticed that they were all different prices in the crab. The managers acted like this is supposed to happen and said we&#39;ll only give you 5% discount for your next meal. After that, me and one of my friends ended up getting a stomach virus and when I notified them of this, the manager said are you sure it&#39;s our food and hung up.

Got the Lobster tower and found a bunch of raw/bad pieces in the pile. Manager said its hard to cook and its fine and did nothing about it. Literally half the pieces we picked up were raw, after a few raw pieces we felt sick and didn&#39;t want it anymore. Huge waste of money and put me in the toilet for 5 hours.\n\\\nExtremely disappointed in my experience dining at this restaurant. We ordered the Lobster (HK style) that was about 4.5 lbs and out of the dish, four of the lobster pieces were raw. We brought it up to the staff every time we found an undercooked piece and the management team just made a poor excuse saying that certain parts of the lobster is harder to cook. I would expect a highly-rated seafood restaurant to have enough experience to serve lobster that is not undercooked. To compensate us for the undercooked food, all they did was offer free soda. We were baffled by how little they seemed to care about serving uncooked food. After expressing our complaints to multiple people in the management team, they resulted in waiving the 12% mandatory service charge on the bill. Overall, I am completely unsatisfied by the meal and even more so of how poorly management handled the situation. I will not be returning to this restaurant and advise others to avoid eating here too unless you want to settle for overpriced food that may come undercooked.\n\\\nQuite a spectacle. Good quality, atmosphere - ate too much and felt bad afterwards but glad we came.\n\\\nFishman Lobster Clubhouse remains my favourite Chinese restaurant in Toronto, after many years and multiple locations.<br><br>&#34;Lobster Mountain&#34; is still the most unique meal in the city, whether it be with fries or fried smelt fish. They actually did away with the latter citing rising costs several years ago. Now with fries and HK-style lobster, it&#39;s a mix of both worlds: east meets west fusion! Kids certainly don&#39;t mind the fries.<br><br>This restaurant is the place for the ultimate seafood experience at reasonable (high) prices. With a reservation, we were seated shortly upon arrival. For our order, a big fresh 5.5 lb lobster was brought to our table for photos. The wok-tossed Lobster Mountain always impresses, not only based on presentation but because each huge piece is crispy, slightly spicy, yet succulent &amp; tender.<br><br>The other dishes also pair well. Lobster roe fried rice has been replaced by a perfectly crispy sweet &amp; sour pork. Silkie chicken soup, snow peas, and sea bass which were more than enough for our table. Dessert is now macarons; I usually find these treats overly sweet but here it is balanced.

Experience was very grand, but be prepared to spend $$$.\n\\\nDelicious lobster but can\\'92t say the same for anything else. I would recommend just getting the lobster and none of the side dishes. The service was great and everything came out quick\n\\\nVisually spectacular. Giant snow crabs and lobsters cooked and piled high.\n\\\nBig portions and delicious food. It\\'92s a special occasion kind of place and my mom really enjoyed the Mother\\'92s Day lunch. We even got some photos of the lobster before he was on our plate. The dessert could have been better though but having said that great meal!\n\\\nIf I were in death row, this would bet final meal. The seafood was so insanely fresh. They literally bring you the shellfish for you to see with the weight for you to inspect before it gets cooked. Lunch was insanely delicious. The service was amazing. The place is perfect. I cannot wait to travel back north just to experience this again.\n\\\nDelicious!  More food than we ate all week!\n\\\nFood\n\\\nIf u have money go for it...if u haven't tasted fried lobster go for it make sure u got atleast $thousand reserves.\n\\\nGreat place great staff great atmosphere. The only problem that I have and it's not even really a problem is that I think they need two or three more servers in the area when it gets busy it gets really busy and you will be sitting with an empty glass for an extended amount of time which I totally understand as they are very busy but the food 100% the best\n\\\nIt was nice being served the lobster tower. Our group was 4 people and we picked the 4 lbs lobster combo.  All dishes were good and we had lots of leftovers.\n\\\n\"People crave about this place, but I found it way overpriced.  We ordered a 4 person fixed menu.  The menu said $499.  There were some upcharges as the lobster was a bit heavier than 3 pounds.  Add 12% for this and 13% for that, the bill came out to $650+\\\n\\\nCash or debit card only! We had cash to pay this, as we never use our debit card to pay for restaurants.  We found this quite common in Toronto... credit cards not allowed.

The Hong Kong style lobster is a must! The crab dish was a bit lackluster in comparison though. The crab fried rice is also delicious-- ask for it to come out with the lobster if you want to avoid the fries! They should add a dry Riesling for the spicy dishes though\n\\\nSimply WOW! Best lobster I have ever tasted. Everything was fantastic. What a culinary experience. Only one minor complaint. They only accept Canadian debit cards or cash. We were with American friends who wanted to invite us and they wouldn't/couldn't accept their cards. Otherwise, everything was perfect.\n\\\nIt\\'92s a scam. They convince you to order a 5lb lobster that they parade out live for you to take pictures. 5 mins later it appears chopped up in a \\'93tower\\'94. Then the same lobster makes a debut appearance at the table next to yours.

You're only paying a premium for the king crab and lobster. It's definitely not an upscale restaurant as service and quality of food, presentation were all very standard. Plates were lightweight plastic. The waiter had us pass our dirty plates over to him instead of collecting from each person himself.\n\\\nIf you love lobster than you have to try their famous Lobster Mountain.

Lobster and king crab were both good, but nothing to run home or rave about.\\\nThe service is minimal, and we wernt asked once how everything was tasting. I believe that for 980 for dinner for 7 people it just simply isn't worth it. (One bottle of wine that must've been 10$ tops. No other beverages)\\\nAlso the fact that they charge tax and gratuity while only accepting cash is a little shady. The cra should really audit this place. I think it'd be a gold mine.\\\n\\\nI think it's worth coming once.\"\n\\\nThe best service.  Impeccable.  We were served fast and the food came fast.

First place your order. Then your live seafood is brought out for you so that you can inspect it. Then its cooked to perfection. Obviously its an expensive place but definitely well worth it!! We got the Lobster tower and do not regret it one bit. My self and two friends ate like kings and had plenty of leftovers. Definitely prepare yourself before coming here and loosen that waistband when you sit down because you'll need the extra room!! Definitely a once in a while treat, but will for sure be back!!\n\\\nOutstanding!!!! Had the fixed dinner for 2 or 3. Honestly, it could have fed 5 people. The lobster was perfection, tender, juicy chunks of meat easily pulled from shell tossed in a crispy, garlicky spicy Hong Kong style seasoning, delicious!!! We asked for our bass to be fried, not steamed, and were graciously accommodated, sweet pea greens in garlic, and last but not least, sweet and sour pork was amazing.  I am highly recommending this place. Make a reservation, bring all your friends and know there is a 2 hour seating limit. The staff were attentive and sweet as well. Plus, before your meal, they bring you your live lobster to say hello... so cool. \\uc0\\u55358 \\u56734 \\u55357 \\u56476 \n\\\nBring ur cash.  No credit accepted unless very Canadian specific.

Even the manager is rude.  Needs customer service training or should be fired.  Whether you disagree with customer or not, does not give you the right to be rude to a customer especially for a manager.  He wore a pink dress shirt.  You willing to spend $1500-$2000 per table and the attitude is they don\\'92t care.  They believe they don\\'92t need to treat customers with respect because they have the business.  For that price, you would expect great SERVICE and food.  Customers need to show restaurants like this that success is based on customer service. I DON\\'92T   recommend this restaurant.\n\\\nThey switched a bit (maybe 10~15%) of the chosen lobster with a previously dead / sick one.  Therefore, dishonest and over priced\n\\\nSumptious..

Lunch is a better option if you have a small group because the portion here is enormous. They also offer a \\'93lunch special\\'94 menu where you can order the lobster mountain by weight (min. 4 lbs), and the set comes with fried rice (good to feed a family of 6), snow pea tips, and a dessert. This whole meal lasted us the entire day with the fried rice that we are still trying to finish up.\\\n\\\nMaking reservations is crucial for dinner but we were able to walk-in during lunch time on a weekend. It is still cash or Canadian debit card, so make sure you withdraw some money ahead of time (we went to the RBC ATM inside Petro-Canada gas station across the road). Paying in USD would incur an unfavorable exchange rate.\\\n\\\nFriendly staff and clean bathroom.

No customer should ever be treated like how we were treated!\\\n\\\nWe did bring up these issues (listed below) to the manager. The male manager did try to resolve these issues by offering us a vip card, BUT WE DID NOT ACCEPT. It's not about the \"\"vip\"\" it's about how we were treated as customers. The amount of food we order, the prices wasn't cheap either. We have 4 very young kids that we have to fed before we can even start eating ourselves. The fact that the female waitresses bad mouth us in front of us, thinking that we didn't understand was wrong already. Employees should not have a bad mouth a customer in front of them whether they understand or not understand the language! Secondly, what kind of training did you provide to your employees. When a customer is still eating (literally chopsticks in their mouth while taking away their plate).\\\n\\\nWe came here because my friend recommended this place. We were thinking about coming back and trying the lobster tower, but after today's experience, we would not be returning customers.\\\n\\\nI called at 8:54 pm. to book a reservation. We are a party of 8 ( 4 adults and 4 young kids). We will arrive at 9:20 pm. AFTER we were seated, we were told the kitchen closed at 10:30 pm and the restaurant closed at 11 pm. The person I made the reservation with never mentioned this.\\\n\\\nAt 10:30 p.m. , the manager came over and politely asked us to pay the bill first, and we could take our time to eat.

Please be prepare to pay at least 50%~75% extra, if not more!  Though the prix fixe menu stated a 8-lb King Crab, they will tell you that the smallest one they have is almost 10 lbs, so you will have to pay roughly $150 more!  Without a doubt the same applied to the listed 8-lb  lobster!  What can you say when everyone has already sat down and settled, especially if you have guests with you!  A prix fixe of $1,088 came out to almost $2,000.   Just google and you\\'92ll easily find similar stories for the past 10 years!  Top that, we were paying for MSG quality food, and 2-star restaurant service.  Then again, you might not believe me til you walk in my shoes, good luck!\n\\\nWent to celebrate with family from overseas. They used to have anchovies in their HK style king crab and lobster. None of that now, instead there is a sweet and sour like taste with mild spice. With the price of over $800 for us, I don't believe it's worth the dishes provided.\n\\\n\"(Translated by Google) It's really delicious! I especially recommend the lobster with catfish sauce. The price is not cheap, as is the case with all lobster dishes, but it is much cheaper than other restaurant-like menus. It's a restaurant I go to every time I entertain guests, and all the guests I've served have been very satisfied. It is perfect for entertaining guests or family gatherings. Among the lunch packages, I think B1, which comes with fried rice and vegetables, is the best value for money.\\\n\\\n(Original)\\\n\\uc0\\u51221 \\u47568  \\u47579  \\u51080 \\u49845 \\u45768 \\u45796 ! \\u53945 \\u55176  \\u47700 \\u44592 \\u49548 \\u49828  \\u46989 \\u49828 \\u53552  \\u52628 \\u52380 \\u54633 \\u45768 \\u45796 . \\u44032 \\u44201 \\u51008  \\u46989 \\u49828 \\u53552  \\u50836 \\u47532 \\u44032  \\u45796  \\u44536 \\u47084 \\u54616 \\u46319  \\u49916 \\u44050 \\u51008  \\u50500 \\u45768 \\u51648 \\u47564   \\u45796 \\u47480  \\u49885 \\u45817  \\u44057 \\u51008  \\u47700 \\u45684 \\u50640  \\u48708 \\u54644  \\u50900 \\u46321 \\u55176  \\u51200 \\u47156 \\u54633 \\u45768 \\u45796 . \\u49552 \\u45784  \\u51217 \\u45824  \\u54624  \\u46412 \\u47560 \\u45796  \\u44845  \\u44032 \\u45716  \\u49885 \\u45817 \\u51064", "doc_id": "9cb59ae4-366f-4280-a434-ed1487710b81", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b9e620f696103302145167f9582e6a0259c62a4f3e056e2bfc359e94ac8a7a6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 112137, "end": 114957}, "relationships": {"1": "7269b0e4-1ae5-420a-98c5-3fde650b87c0", "2": "4139dd2e-b31d-4c7e-994f-0f057f49d778", "3": "96e89232-980b-44c9-97fc-bb35c6b5ed7d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "96e89232-980b-44c9-97fc-bb35c6b5ed7d": {"__data__": {"text": "\\u45796  \\u44536 \\u47084 \\u54616 \\u46319  \\u49916 \\u44050 \\u51008  \\u50500 \\u45768 \\u51648 \\u47564   \\u45796 \\u47480  \\u49885 \\u45817  \\u44057 \\u51008  \\u47700 \\u45684 \\u50640  \\u48708 \\u54644  \\u50900 \\u46321 \\u55176  \\u51200 \\u47156 \\u54633 \\u45768 \\u45796 . \\u49552 \\u45784  \\u51217 \\u45824  \\u54624  \\u46412 \\u47560 \\u45796  \\u44845  \\u44032 \\u45716  \\u49885 \\u45817 \\u51064 \\u45936  \\u47784 \\u49884 \\u44256  \\u44036  \\u49552 \\u45784 \\u46308  \\u47784 \\u46160  \\u50500 \\u51452  \\u47564 \\u51313  \\u54616 \\u45908 \\u46972 \\u44396 \\u50836 . \\u49552 \\u45784  \\u51217 \\u45824 \\u45208  \\u44032 \\u51313 \\u47784 \\u51076 \\u50640  \\u46385  \\u51077 \\u45768 \\u45796 . \\u47088 \\u52824  \\u54056 \\u53412 \\u51648 \\u51473  \\u48374 \\u51020 \\u48165 \\u44284  \\u52292 \\u49548 \\u44032  \\u44057 \\u51060  \\u45208 \\u50724 \\u45716  B1 \\u51060  \\u44032 \\u51109  \\u44032 \\u49457 \\u48708  \\u51339 \\u51008 \\u44144  \\u44057 \\u50500 \\u50836 .\"\n\\\nWe ordered the 6 person double lobster combo and the the fried oyster with green onion.

The set meal also came with a bunch of other dishes including steamed bass, which was one of my favs. Overall great place for special occasions and large get togethers! Per person we paid roughly $100\n\\\nFirst of all, this is an experience - an expensive one but one that's worth it!  The restaurant is surrounded by tanks filled with crustaceans - you can order ala carte or choose from several predetermined menu combinations.  Most of the lobster and crab are purchased by the pound.  Once you've determined what you're ordering, they will bring you the actual live lobster and / or crabs for you to inspect before they are cooked.  The presentation is amazing - our lobster was served Hong Kong style in a tower, and wow, it's just delicious! There's enough food that you're probably going home with some so order sparingly.\n\\\n\"Came here for dinner the other day for a friend's bday. There were four of us and we ordered a combo dinner consisting of deep-fried lobster in Hong Kong sauce, fried bass, steamed crab, and snow pea tips (its kind of like spinach). The deep-fried lobster was pretty good but the HK sauce is just ok. It's basically just a soy sauce. I give it a 7/10. I saw lots of other tables order it without the sauce or with a different one. The fried bass wasn't seasoned and very bland. They should serve it with soy sauce or something. Oh wait, they did but even that was bland.

The deep-fried lobster was pretty good but the HK sauce is just ok. It's basically just a soy sauce. I give it a 7/10. I saw lots of other tables order it without the sauce or with a different one. The fried bass wasn't seasoned and very bland. They should serve it with soy sauce or something. Oh wait, they did but even that was bland. How is that even possible? 4/10, next. The steamed crab was also bland. 3/10, nothing to see here. The snow pea tips was alright. This dish was seasoned, surprisingly. Still didn't taste like much but it's basically spinach so what did I expect? 5/10. They also got us started with some chicken broth soup but that was unseasoned as well so I had a couple sips and put it aside. I don't know what was going on but maybe there was a salt shortage? Won't bother rating it because it doesn't deserve one. For dessert, they served us with 6 bite-sized pieces of mango pudding. The mango taste is actually pretty good but the texture was a little off. A bit too hard and solid for my taste. Similar to those puddings you get at all-you-can-eat sushi places. Probably would've enjoyed it more if the texture was softer like jell-o. Solid 6/10. When the bill came, I was surprised to see a 12% gratuity charge already on it. I assume this is because some Asian people don't tip because tipping culture doesn't exist over there. Or maybe it was because everyone was only tipping 10%. The servers were polite but not very friendly. The food comes out fast (it wasn't that busy) and they let you take pictures with the lobster and crab before they cook it. But the service isn't anything to speak of. Luckily I had some cash, because they only take cash or debit. The total was around $300. Split four ways that's $75 each. 3/10 for value. Not sure why they're charging so much for food that's neither unique or difficult to make. It might have something to do with the target audience of this restaurant. It's close to a lot of office buildings, the servers look professional with their suits and standoffish manner, the shelves are stocked with wine bottles, etc. It all comes down to appearances. These guys are basically fooling people into thinking this is a gourmet dining experience when it's actually just an overpriced, average-tasting chinese restaurant that looks high-end.\\\n\\\nVerdict: You'll probably try it once but realize that it's not worth it.\"\n\\\n\"(Translated by Google) The taste has nothing to say\\\n\\\n(Original)\\\n\\uc0\\u21619 \\u36947 \\u27809 \\u24471 \\u35828 \"\n\\\n\"(Translated by Google) The lobster feels fresh, but tasteless\\\n\\\n(Original)\\\n\\uc0\\u40857 \\u34430 \\u24863 \\u35273 \\u25402 \\u26032 \\u40092 \\u65292 \\u20294 \\u26159 \\u27809 \\u20837 \\u21619 \"\n\\\nThe best lobster I've had hands down.

I then placed my order and another staff member walked my order 1 lobster and 1 Vancouver crab out for me to see and quickly showed me the price (I still haven't seen the price) as he handed it over to the first staff member. She then completed my order that came up to $175 after adding the lobster fried rice (not worth it). The only reason they're not getting a 1 star for service is because they helped me bring the food to my car as I was holding my son.\\\n\\\nThe lobster was done Hong Kong style and the crab in ginger and garlic, both cooked well, however, the price and taste don't add up to worth it in my eye.\\\n\\\nTake the trip there if you'd like, however, I'm a look for another seafood place that has the taste to match the price.\"\n\\\nFantastic.  My daughter and son-in-law took me for my birthday. Will go again.\n\\\n\"Food was good from soup to lobster to dessert. However, I don't think anyone would just come here for a dinner. I recommend this place on a special occasion ie my son just turned 30. I can recommend restaurant with similar food that's about $100 cheaper.\\\nBUT the food was good.\"}", "doc_id": "0bfcc91a-1048-4da7-9812-a3ac28294519", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "17fc703d614b22f14d3fdc9f504fd0a53cffe94958fe107a5150e087810e4f08", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 121172, "end": 123222}, "relationships": {"1": "7269b0e4-1ae5-420a-98c5-3fde650b87c0", "2": "0b13416b-ff3c-4acb-916a-afb6f6429ff3"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
