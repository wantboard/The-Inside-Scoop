Amazing Persian food. The meats are incredible but the real star of the show are the yogurt dips and bread. SO good, the dip with broccoli rabe and pistachios is absolutely addicting. The koobideh was incredible and the lamb chops were unreal. Really cool vibes in the restaurant, perfect for a date night or a dinner with friends. Cannot recommend this place enough!\nEverything about this place is good. Great flavors, professional and friendly staff. An amazing looking kitchen as well.\n\"OK! I need a moment of silence to realize what I ate!!! OMG! This place was the bessssst!\nI\u2019m %100 sure you wouldn\u2019t find another restaurant like this.\nEverything was perfect, I mean it!!! From the first drink until the end.\nWe did our best to try most of the food (which was impossible; they had many options)!\nI had the best drinks, Persian food, and dessert here.\nAnd I have to admit their decor was so unique, and you\u2019ll see a lot of touches from Iran.\nDefinitely recommend this place. \ud83e\udd29\"\nAmazing food and ambiance. Staff was knowledgeable and did a great job of guiding us throughout our meal. All the appetizers were amazing and the veal entree was a standout. Would jump at an opportunity to come back.\nThe vibe of the restaurant is amazing, with a cozy and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. The drinks menu is also fantastic, featuring an impressive selection of mezcal cocktails that are expertly crafted and absolutely delicious. But the real star of the show at Eyval is the food. The Fesenjoon and Koobideh were absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend both dishes. Overall, I would give Eyval my highest recommendation and encourage anyone looking for a great dining experience to check it out.\nFantastic!!! The food was delicious, the staff super nice and friendly. Great atmosphere and music! I highly recommend!\n\"Eyval broke the spell of experiencing mediocre to bad restaurants. Everything from the appearance and decoration to the menu and the actual foods and drinks surprised me and all my companies. The creativity in appropriating Iranian dish did not upset us! Quite the opposite, we enjoyed how well-thought every single item on the menu was.\n\nThere were a few items that were okay, such as the drink with Aperol, or the size of barbari bread (very tiny!), or the absence of dates from Kumaj, but overall, the menu was creative and delicious more than anything else. I would say the dessert menu could be much richer given the variety of Iranian huge variation of sweets though.\n\nMost items are good for one person, even the entrees that are supposedly to be shared, so the price might be a little high. But again, the extent we enjoyed our food in that atmosphere was so high that I easily can overlook the downsides and keep visiting Eyval forever!\"\nHonestly fantastic. Cocktails, food, all of it. Everything was delicious. Ordered two breads, one dip, 3 appetizer-y dishes and 1 entree. Was a lot of food for two people but we still ate it all, haha. Instantly knew I'd be back again...and again and again.\nPrices are high but service is", "doc_id": "6b8ad96f-dcfd-49d5-a7c8-1122910c4b62", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "231c136324af55027c291344eb00f378cd76dbaa8d2d05f697b13d5680d824ca", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 16717, "end": 20485}, "relationships": {"1": "6cb67fca-0347-4fa3-9c8c-55c44b408639", "2": "466c075b-48ad-449d-84ad-1a154249c3ef", "3": "2066968f-1151-4261-82d6-926e402cda3c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2066968f-1151-4261-82d6-926e402cda3c": {"__data__": {"text": "but overall, the menu was creative and delicious more than anything else.

The service was spectacular and the food was incredibly flavorful. Everything was perfectly cooked and there was so much love and thought put into each plate. The atmosphere was super lively and romantic. Perfect for a special occasion with family, friends or loved ones. Great drinks as well with wonderful persian flavors\nOutstanding. One of my favorite restaurants in NY at the moment. The breads and dips are delicious, as is the Saffron Martini. The Kashke Bademjan is incredibly savory and umami-rich. The latifeh and tea are a great way to finish off the meal.\nInteresting concept but eyval just didn\u2019t get it right. Not one Persian works there and they have no hedgehog concept. They are banking on tourists and rich locals to take in the ambience and although the inside is very homey and they are playing old Persian films, the food is mediocre at best. They don\u2019t even have masto khiyar and the portions are small and where is the Persian experience with sumac, ghormeh sabzi etc? Contact me if you want some guidance as I had two Persian restaurants in the VA area. 180 dollar bills for two people and mediocre food will only get you one time customers.\nIncredibly delicious & thoughtful food, drinks, service - a truly cohesive vision.\nPerfect location for a surprise B-day celebration\nFood was pretty good. The waiter was very nice\n\"The food was incredible. Every single dish had depth and nuance.\n\nI was not impressed by the cocktails, especially at their price point.\"\nAmazing food\nReally impressed and pleased with the food and service at Eyval. We were running late and couldn\u2019t get a hold of the restaurant (no phone) so our table was given away. Despite that, Casey and Cat made every attempt to accommodate us. The service was phenomenal and the food was so good that we can\u2019t wait to come back again. Thank you  to the team for being so kind and serving us so quickly. Truly appreciated their generosity!\n\"This place is great! The restaurant is a bit far from me, located in the heart of Bushwick. But the trip out was worth it!\n\nGreat Persian food. We ordered quite a few dishes including a tomato salad, the whipped feta, beef and chicken kebab, and a lamb heart salad (really good!). We didn't have reservations but came as soon as the restaurant opened at 6p and were able to secure a seat at the bar. The staff was super friendly and helpful throughout the meal and we really enjoyed it.\n\nIf you're in the area, highly recommend this restaurant! Great find and will be back\"\nWhile visiting my brother, we tried eyval. This is nouveau Persian cuisine. At first glance i wasn\u2019t sure if I would like it, but boy was I quickly proven wrong. It is food I had during my childhood but with a sophisticated twist. For those who know Persian cuisine, you would know that all Persians love a stew called ghormesabzi, Eyval took this dish an elevated it. Instead of having cubed beef in it.

They place a beautiful osso bucco in the middle of the plate sured with the stew. What an amazing concept. Every dish they have,  is elevated Persian food. From their kashke bademjan to their kabab koobideh. Very well thought concept. Very cool ambiance, and a very interesting menu. A must try.\nFantastic food, great experience\nThe best lamb I have ever had\u2026\u2026 and I eat way too much lamb\nDelicious from start to finish. I can\u2019t remember the last time I went to a restaurant and loved everything\u2014not a single dish wasn\u2019t stellar.  For 4 people we got the shallot yogurt, two Barbari bread, roasted squash, Khashkeh badimjoon, koobideh, grilled octopus, duck fesenjoon, and\u2026can\u2019t remember the name but it was like an upleveled airy whoopie pie. Can\u2019t wait to come back.\nAmazing food and extremely nice staff\nWhen I arrived with my party of 4 at 7pm on Thursday, I was flustered to find that I had messed up my reservation. The floor manager really didn't have room for us with the existing reservations for the night but finagled her bookings to squeeze us into a table. She then expedited our food so that we could fully enjoy the menu for our allotted 75 minutes. The food was absolutely fantastic, full of bright flavors, wonderful bursts of acidity and perfectly cooked proteins. Highly recommend both breads, the lamb salad, roasted eggplant, hamachi and the scallops. Drinks were also great but what I'll remember most is the service. Thank you Eyval team for being so hospitable!!\n\"Great dining experience. Delicious food. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, nice decor and friendly atmosphere.\n\nMy only surprise was that they didn\u2019t use their platform to raise awareness around the social injustices issues transpiring in iran right now. A simple banner , a #mahsa amini or anything\"\n\"We experienced this amazing cuisine couples weeks ago and it were phenomenal & delicious.\nHighly recommended and definitely will come back!\"\nEyval is my favorite restaurant in New York and the best Iranian restaurant in US! As an Iranian I try to go to as many iranian restaurant as I can when I travel but this time I went back twice to this place because it\u2019s that good! Everything was great but I do recommend getting the squash salad before they take it out of their menu and the season is gone \ud83d\udc4c\nEVERYTHING IS super good\nPlace was empty but they wouldn't seat us for 2.5 hours\nThe food is so so delicious, the service is a 10/10, and the ambiance is great. I can\u2019t wait to go back!\nThis place is fantastic. The kebab is not to be missed! Such cute decor and ambiance. Can\u2019t wait to go back\n\"We stopped by here for the first time for our anniversary. The environment is warm and friendly. The kitchen has glass walls and is visible to everyone. As a Persian, I had the best Gourmet Sabzi of my life. The latifeh sweet was also amazing.\n\nOur only complaint is that different staff kept on taking away our dishes while we were eating and we had to stop them.

The yogurt dips require bread and the bread is $6-8 a piece which is absurd. Scallops were cooked incredibly well but served with a flavorful dip that required\u2026 bread or rice to balance it out (which did not come with the dish, IMO should have).  Eggplant lamb dish just wasn\u2019t a winner.  Chilled house red was good.  Probs won\u2019t be back.\nTook my wife who is Persian. She loved it. I loved it.\nInsanely good\ncan't wait to come back and try some different dishes\n\"I had the best Persian food ever here \ud83e\udd72\nYou must try their \u201cEggplant and cured yoghurt,\u201d \u201ctahdig and plum sauce,\u201d \u201cgheyme bademjan,\u201d \u201cghalie mahi.\u201d Oh and don't forget to try their Komaj bread and for dessert have the Latifah, you'll love its texture and how delicious it is.\"\nthe food, design, service and everything about this place is my favorite!\nReally great food.
