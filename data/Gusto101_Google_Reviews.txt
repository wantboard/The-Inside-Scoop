"Been here a couple of times and Gusto never disappoints. Firstly, even for a busy restaurant they have plenty of outdoor seating (patio and rooftop) and would be happy to accommodate you irrespective of a booking or not (but we have been only 2 people though!)\

The food is excellent! The salads taste fresh, the appetizers are a good portion (lamb meatballs are super tasty!). The pastas are smaller in portion but have an impeccable taste (truffle paste is a must-try!!!!). Their tiramisu is one of the best I've tried in Toronto, SO SO GOOD!\
\
Lastly, their staff is friendly and service is quick. Would highly recommend it!"\
"This place is great. The atmosphere is amazing. And the ground floor smells so good! We got a pasta, pizza and brussels sprouts app for two people. The brussels sprouts and pasta was 10/10! The pizza was more on the bottom side at 4/10. The crust was just too dry and not enough flavor. Maybe offer a dipping sauce? Their tiramisu was 9/10. It was a great portion. Enough for two people.\
\
We came here on a weekday at 5 pm because that is what their website said was available. But even at 7 pm, there were a lot of tables.\
\
Overall, good experience. We will be back for the pasta for sure!"\
"Amazing Italian restaurant.\
\
The atmosphere as soon as you walked in was welcoming and exciting and it seemed like everybody there loved being there. We got seats on the rooftop and it was absolutely lovely.\
\
My table shared the eggplant appetizer and I got the mushroom pizza and both were phenomenal. I work at a pizza place so I don\'92t often enjoy other pizza but something about it this one was so good, I couldn\'92t resist.\
\
Our server was okay. He was kind and knew about the menu but not too amicable. It took a while for both the food and the bill to come, which I guess is normal for a Friday night but I still believe it could have been better.\
\
Perhaps a little pricey but, for the Toronto Fashion District, it\'92s about expected."\
"Gusto 101 has a great ambience. It\'92s high ceilings and it\'92s industrial loft finishes really give it a cool feel and look.\
\
Great service and delicious food. The Octopus and Black Kale salad were fantastic!\
\
I ate more but forgot to take a photo as it was too delicious.\
\
I will definitely be back to Gusto 101"\
"Food and the vibes are so good here.\
Calamari 9/10. Crispy with good sauce.\
Mushroom pasta 10/10 . Love these type of noodles & they were cooked perfectly aldente.\
Kale Caesar 8/10 (could use more kale massaging. A little rough tasting)\
We also got the 1oz for $1 deal on the wine. Red was very good."\
"Food is great but it is sooo busy and loud( perhaps the architecture makes every noise echo) that makes it a bit stressful for dining.\
We had our usual mushroom pasta that was delicious but tried their steak for the first time and it was one of the best I\'92ve had!! I also really enjoyed the octopus as starter."\
"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at this restaurant.\
We dined upstairs to appreciate the open rooftop.\
The food was great. We had the calamari, beef carpaccio and pizza.\
The calamari was a good portion, but small pieces. The beef carpaccio was so delicious. To compliment the dish, I wished it came with bread.\
We loved the pizza. Very tasty flavors.\
I would definitely come back again."\
"Everything was very good \uc0\u55357 \u56845  especially the mushroom truffle pasta.\
The Tiramisu has crunchy texture from the dry lady finger (I don't know if it was on purpose, or is there any mistake) so for the tiramisu it self it's not my go to.\
But the rest are amazing, service are amazing."\
Went for my wife\'92s birthday and it was an absolute treat. We ordered focaccia and was tasteful. For mains. We ordered truffle sauce pasta and margarita pasta which was pure delight. The pasta is a must try if you are into white sauce and fungi/mushrooms. Would definitely go again.\
Nice atmosphere, food was delicious. Our first waitress got annoyed about us wanting to move tables because it was getting too cold by the window. But the second waitress was much nicer and was extremely helpful. Would love to go back and try the other items on their menu.\
"Went here for a birthday, which was my first time here. I ordered pizza, and focaccia.\
\
Everything was great, the pizza was not the best I ever had but very good. Except for the focaccia, which may have been the best I\'92ve ever had!\
\
The atmosphere is very welcoming including the beautiful patio out front. Washrooms are in the basement via stairs, not wheelchair assessable."\
Ive heard about gusto for a few years now. As soon as I had the chance to go to Toronto I made a reservation. The truffle pasta did not disappoint and would definitely be back next time I\'92m around! Great service and food all throughout.\
"If you want atmosphere and ambiance with tasty food, this is the place to go. The food is incredible and the wine is paid by the ounce on Tuesdays which makes it a good place for wine on a budget. The truffle pasta (malfam\'e9 ai fungi) was amazing. We went as a group of 4 and had focaccia, Brussel sprouts, kale salad and calamari to start with truffle pasta as our mains.\
I\'92m rating 4 stars as they forgot to celebrate our birthday! Our server was not attentive, we had to wait very long to get their attention and order and it took 40 minutes to get our bill with the server coming back to ask what we ordered to re-enter the items for the bill."\
"It\'92s been forever since I ate here. First time was a few years ago.  It tastes the exact same as the first time.\
\
The mushroom pasta is easily 5/5 stars. The red sauce dish (forgot the name) could not live up to the deliciousness.\
\
The place is always crazy busy so expect to wait quite a while for a table"\
First timer at Gusto! Popped by for some quick drinks and apps. Everything was super tasty plus the service was great. I\'92ll definitely be back for dinner next time because I seriously have to try the mushroom pasta (looks so good!)\
"Recently visited Gusto 101 and we thoroughly enjoyed the vibe as well as food!! So good!\
I think it\'92s a great place to catch up with friends on an evening or for a lovely date. It\'92s a bit crowded though, yet enjoyable. The vibe is so cool with dim lights. I find it like a nice Instagrammable restaurant if you love good food, photos, videos and reels!! I\'92m definitely coming back to try more of their delights! \uc0\u55357 \u56845 \u55357 \u56845 "\
Gusto has delicious pizzas and pastas. The pasta portions are a little small compared to other places but every one we ordered (we got all except the lasagna) was really yummy. The upstairs patio space is nicely laid out too. Be prepared to wait though as they do not take reservations.\
I have been wanting to try this place since before the pandemic when my co-worker first told me about it. We visit Mississauga every year to visit family, but due to the pandemic, we haven't been in the past two years. The funghi pasta came highly recommended by my co-worker, so I had to try that. My husband and I also ordered the lamb meatballs for an appetizer, daviola pizza, the strip steak and tiramisu. The funghi pasta was AMAZING, and something that I would totally get every time. Everything else was really good too, cooked to perfection. Can't wait to come back again during our next visit.\
"Got lasagna and the mushroom pasta here and it was fabulous. The serving of mushroom pasta was very filling and they were generous with the mushrooms too.\
\
The service was alright and the food took a very long time to come but they looked busy and perhaps understaffed so that couldn\'92t be helped.\
\
Overall, the pasta here made the experience so worth it and I would recommend it highly!"\
The fungi cream pasta was Phenomenal. The steak, even more. You just can't go wrong. Make sure to start off with their Brussels sprouts if you're a fan. The fungi pizza was good but heavy if you're planning on having it among other things.\
"Gusto 101 - Celebrating my big 4 0 today and the wifey planned a lovely luncheon. Definitely one of my favourite Italian joints in our great city.\
\
For starters we got the carpacccio and their newest salad the invernale (citrus, persimmons, fennel, olives and chilli). Both we absolutely delicious and light enough so we had room for our mains.\
\
Whenever you visit @gusto101to you must order their malfalde ai funghi and this time we also copped the grilled branzino (I love seafood). Both were executed perfectly and we left completely satisfied. What a great meal with amazing service! #TomEatsYummyFoodBecauseWhyNot"\
Summer weather is definitely here and Gusto 101 is such a vibe to be at! There food is absolutely amazing and the staff are very friendly and accommodating! Definitely will be back to try the rest of their menu!\
"One of the best Italian place in Toronto. Been a regular customer for a while now. If you want good food, cozy atmosphere, and good service this place is worth to visit.\
Their mushroom pasta definitely the best one in the city, not too heavy and the pasta is cooked perfectly. Their pizza is top notch as well. For appetizer I would recommend calamari. For tiramisu, it's decent but not the best one in town, the lady fingers not moist enough and doesn't absorb the coffee/espresso enough."\
"I\'92ve been wanting to come to Gusto for the longest time and never got around to it. How have I put it off so long. The atmosphere and space is great for an intimate dinner to catching up with a group of friends. The drinks were on point and the food\'85 AMAZING rich flavour.\
\
Don\'92t be like me and wait for this, just go, run!"\
Visited here with friends and had a great experience. We didnt have a reservation but had a seat at the rooftop bistro tables which weren\'92t really comfortable. The service was fast and nice, the food and drinks came on time and the cocktails were great. The truffle mushroom pasta was reallyyyyyyyy amazing and it was worth the hype. Also the burger was very juicy and flavorful, adding on the calamari was tasty and crispy as well. We will definitely come back again and would definitely recommend this place.\
Gusto is always a good idea. Both locations  Offer beautiful patios with plenty of sunshine. The food is always consistent and service friendly.  Best part about the place is there a dollar ounce house wine and properly traditional Italian eats!\
Great atmosphere and dining experience. Super charismatic and attentive staff. We greatly enjoyed the food and sitting at the bar. The Calamarata shrimp pasta was fresh and light; the Salsicce pizza with sausage was really delicious as well. A fluffy tiramisu and rich cannoli were delightful endings to our meal. Compliments to the chef!\
The food was quite tasty. Started off with a lamb meatball and tomato sauce with burnt toast. Good taste minus the bread. The star here I would recommend is the pastas. One dish has lots of mushrooms and cream with truffle flavours the other is the bolognese with beef and pork which is meaty. Wish they would ask to add cheese and pepper though.\
"A friend of mine recommended this bustling spot - and it wowed me!  The food was top notch, every bite was so flavourful. The beef carpaccio was the best I've ever had.  Every dish was absolutely amazing.   Definitely a new fav spot for comfort food!\
\
The tables are packed in quite tight, someone knocked a drink over on my table trying to squeeze in. (He very kindly got us a round-ty!)  The washrooms are communal which isn't my fav, but that's nbd when there are so many other positives.\
\
My server was Sydney, she was attentive and personable.  I highly recommend.\
I'll be back soon!\uc0\u55357 \u56842 "\
Came here with friends; i liked their espresso martini. Their signature mafaldi ai funghi is a must-have, and I also very much enjoyed their bolognese.  The mafaldi sauce is quite rich and heavy so if you prefer a lighter pasta this wont be for you.  I also had the cacio e pepe and I was very disappointed with that- i would say to avoid that dish.  Overall ambiance was great, would return for the initial two pasta dishes.\
"The outside patio was a definitely a vibe!!\
Ordered the Polpette Di Carne , Matalde Al Funghi, and Tiramisu and would highly recommend all of these. Drinks were also great. The service was quick and the servers were amazing! Overall, satisfied with my visit and will be back again."\
"The food is delicious. The Diavola pizza, pasta, foccacia, everything was really good and would recommend. The service unfortunately was lacking.\
My party of 5 had to go out of our way to find our server who was hanging out in the back chatting, and the bartender had to help us call for him so we can order. He also spilled water on our table while pouring water for us and we had to, again, go out of our way to request for napkins so we can clean up the water."\
Good pasta and very aesthetic spot. The first floor is more intimate whereas the second floor is more spacious. The calamarata, lasagna and fried calamaris were great. It's a must-do (if you can get a spot) in the King West area!\
"Not to many places I'd order the same meal on my next visit, but the pizza and pasta was so good I'd order it again. And you gotta try the purple kale ceasar salad, it was the star of the show.\
\
Make reservations and go here for a great date night.\
\
I would of gave it a 5 \uc0\u55356 \u57119 but it is alittle loud."\
Gusto 101 was definitely one of the highlights of our Toronto visit. We ordered their house made focaccia, their famous Mafalde Ai Funghi (mushroom pasta) and the Calamarata (shrimp pomodoro pasta). While I wouldn't recommend their bread, the pasta is absolutely delicious - some of the best we've ever had. The mushroom pasta was covered in a truffle  cream sauce and was AMAZING. The calamarata was actually my personal favorite! I'm not big on wine, so I paired it with some Birra Moretti - an Italian lager that was light and refreshing. We didn't get a chance to order their pizza, but it looked excellent. I can't wait to come back again to try some of their other dishes.\
"The place is always busy, I tried twice before to get a table but failed. Finally third time is the charm.\
\
The food is good but I find it overpriced compared to the quantity, it isn\'92t as fulfilling. I tried their mushroom truffle pasta, few cocktails and tiramisu, everything tasted delicious.\
\
They didn\'92t have much vegetarian/vegan options on their menu so that\'92s a bummer. I personally think it is overhyped.\
\
Italian food | Pasta | Tiramisu"\
Tried the brussel sprouts & mushroom pasta. It was okay, nothing terribly special. Service was okay, a bit slow but kind of expected because it was busy. The chair i was seated at kept shaking every time someone walked by, I think it\'92s because of flooring. Not really something I would have again. Overall ok experience.\
"They have literally the best truffle mushroom pasta anyone can ever ask for! If you come here you have to order this signature dish! It is so good\
\

"Everything was delicious and service was very nice.\
\
Docked a star because they knowingly sat us near a leaky window and we kept getting splashed by water while it was raining outside. Tip: either fix the leak or don\'92t seat your customers right underneath it!"\
Went as a walk in and did not have to wait at all. Great place with great vibes. We ordered Mafalde ai funghi pasta, lamb meatballs, house made focaccia bread and moscow mule cocktail. I would definitely recommend the lamb meatballs and house made focaccia bread. However, we could not enjoy the pasta as it turned cold within 5 minutes. It was so cold and windy outside yet they had AC turned to a point which made our food too cold quickly within 5 minutes. Otherwise it would have been a 5 star review. Having said that, we really enjoyed our time there. The service was amazing. I loved how the server helped us with a huge smile.\
"All dished was flavorful but not heavy.\
Great flavour. Roof top was an nice out and great experience."\
This is a nice restaurant! Nothing remarkable, but it\'92s worth it as it\'92s not that pricey. Pastas are good. The cheesecake dessert was amazing. Beef carpaccio was okey.\
"Our server was amazing! So knowledgeable about the wine selection and the food options. He was absolutely lovely. The wine paired beautifully with our pizza and pasta.\
The food was really good and we enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe. I\'92ll definitely be back!"\
Food is amazing! Cocktail was ok. Mushroom pasta was so good that I forgot to take a picture\'85must-try!!\
The food is good; it is hearty and feels homey. Customer service isn\'92t that great. Our waitress took 30 minutes to bring us the extra spoon that we requested; we already finished our meal by then.\
Amazing Italian food in such a vibrant neighborhood. Their Lasagna is super delicious. And I'd also recommend trying  Pasta over pizza.\
So delicious! Service was great! The restaurant was super busy and packed when we arrived, but everything arrived to our table in incredible timing and was so hot and fresh!\
We always order in dinner from Gusto, and the experience is always amazing. One of the best and most simple pastas I have ever had, the pizza is also one of the best in Toronto. Today we decided to go have dinner in the restaurant and it was even better. The service was great, we didn\'92t do a reservation, but they gave us a sit right away. The food arrives fast and it was as good as the other times we ordered in. The drinks were also well done. Gusto is a must have!\
Whenever I'm in Toronto, I always make a stop at Gusto. The Mafalde Ai Funghi (pasta with truffle cream sauce) and Cavollo Nero (kale salad) and tiramisu were absolutely delightful. Their house wines are still $1/oz and I am just the happiest glowing girl. The service slaps.\
I love the MAFALDE AI FUNGHI pasta. However, the last time I went to gusto it didn\'92t taste as good, wasn\'92t as rich as it used to be (in comparison to pre-Covid days). The pasta sauce was way more rich and thick with a lot more flavour but now it\'92s more watered down. Regardless, I still love this pasta. Ambience is great as well. The no reservation policy is terrible if you\'92re driving from a far distance. Rating it a 4 due to inconvenience of the policy and inconsistency in the pasta.\
Gusto 101 is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. We tried their burger,  pastas and the pepperoni pizza! I\'92d give the food 4/5 and the dessert! OMGosh! Pistachio cannolis\'85. Are to die for -5/5 must try !\
"If you are looking for Italian food with a kick of spices - this is the place to come to. However get ready for some mixed service expectations. Ill elaborate below.\
\
Food: Fantastico! We ordered 2 pizzas and a pasta - all of them were delicious. The pasta could be boiled for some more time as it was crunchy, but the quality of mushrooms and truffle was top-notch!\
\
Service: a little mixed about this. They gave us a table close to the kitchen which made it a little hot. My wife was having back pain so we requested to sit by the sofa but the first 2 servers just declined our request outright in a very rude manner. They were giving excuses that those tables are booked for bigger groups while we saw similar tables with only 2 guests on each table. In addition, this restaurant does not take reservations. A 3rd server approached us and we requested her and showed her the sofa tables with 2 guests. She was kind enough to check with the manager and we finally got a table with sofa. Our server was superb who helped us get a table and we complained to her about the other servers who were rude and did not help with our requests.\
\
Honestly I want to give this place 5 stars but the initial servers spoiled our mood and experience. The food is superb with some minor opportunities for improvement, but the main problem that the management needs to fix is the hospitality of the servers."\
"This place was on our radar for two years and we ended up making it here last week.\
Being here for the first time we stuck to their house baked focaccia to begin with and for mains we tried the traditional Margherita ( one can never go wrong with this classic) and the Iconic Mafalde ai Funghi which was out of this world. Such an amazing ambience with warm and Rustic fine Italian vibes, the food and the service was top notch.\
Will be back soon again."\
Great food! The kale salad, margarita pizza and truffle pasta all were delicious. Very nice staff.\
I don\'92t know why I didn\'92t visit sooner! Food was awesome! Soo goood that I wanted to lick my plate after because the Malfade Al Funghi was amazing! Burger + fries & aioli was so yummy! Can\'92t forget about the Beef Carpaccio \uc0\u55358 \u56588 \u55356 \u57340  We waited a little while for our food but the hosts had such great customer service and offered dessert on the house to us.\
"Finally got to try this place! I've been to Nervosa but never Gusto all these years. I was happy to discover recently before trying Gusto that they have the same owners and the famous mushroom Truffle pasta and Margherita Pizza from Nervosa is the exact same offered at Gusto!\
\
We ordered:\
Beef Carpaccio\
Margherita Pizza\
12oz Bistecca\
Mafalde Ai Funghi\
Mavalcea\
Tequila\
\
The Carpaccio was good, very mild tasting and the beans on top was a nice balance in flavor. Pizza was same as I remember from Nervosa as well as my all time favourite Madalde Ai Funghi with their homemade pasta noodles!\
They actually overcooked the steak from medium rare to medium well but it was still soft as a good cut so we didn't complain to the server.\
\
Looking forward to trying the kale salad next time!"\
This place is superb! The most authentic Italian restaurant you could have ever visited. The pastas we tried were amazing and very flavourful. We will be definitely coming back.\
Their Mafalde Al Funghi is super popular, I love the mix of oyster mushrooms and truffle cream sauce with the pasta. We also tried out the Diavola which was super yummy, I loved the salami and roasted peppers.\
"Came downtown to visit this well know place. We arrived around 5..line up. My suggestion is give ppl the opportunity to scan the QR code while waiting in line not when they are near the front.\
We were directed to go upstairs( poor lighting in the stairwell).\
Our server was excellent. Attentive and friendly.\
We had a few appetizers and a pizza. I have to say with all the hype about this restaurant I wasn't blown away. Although the arancini looked good, the taste just wasn't impressive.\
My husband had the lamb meatballs and they were good smothered in a nice tomato sauce.\
The pizza was good ( thin crisp crust), pretty good flavour . I guess I was expecting better.\
We got a bottle of wine  ($67)-that was  a pretty big mark up for a mediocre bottle of Italian red.\
The ambiance was pretty good. We were seated by a window that overlooked some garbage area ( out of the window).- which I think could be easily  remedied by some opaque window film.\
Probably wouldn't return when there are  sooo many others to choose from.\uc0\u55358 \u56631 \u8205 \u9792 \u65039 "\
"Gusto101 has been my favourite Italian spot when it comes to pasta and dessert. Definitely a must try at least once in your life!\
\
Pictured:\
\'93Mafalde Ai Funghi\'94 - it comes with 3 kinds of mushroom - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, and the pasta is cooked to al dente with truffle cream sauce! Yum!!\
I\'92d suggest to order \'93Cavolo Nero\'94 - lacinato kale, zante currants, toasted pinenuts, pecorino, parmigiano, lemon vinaigrette - to balance out the pasta.\
\
And their tiramisu is so creamy & delicious. Much-needed to end your amazing meal\
\
Follow my IG: @astravel_eats"\
"Have visited Gusto 101 a few times and am delighted every time. This Italian restaurant has a wonderful ambiance, good music, and very professional staff who pay attention to details. The upstairs dining was closed as it was a Sunday.\
\
For starters, we ordered the Carpaccio and Burrata. The Carpaccio was delicious, complimentary flavours that all worked together, especially the mushrooms and parmagiano! The Burrata cheese was very good, however it could have used an extra flavour to complete the dish.\
\
For our main, we had the Malfade ai Fungahi and the Lamb Meatballs. The Malfade is Fungahi is to die for and arguably the best dish in the city and the best pasta dish I have personally had! It is a mushroom pasta dish - so creamy and rich with a truffle cream sauce over al dents wide pasta. Would eat this every day!! The Lamb Meatballs were perfectly seasoned and served with a dollop of ricotta. The only suggestion I would have is to add a nice sear on the meatballs to provide some texture. But it was still very good.\
\
Overall a great experience. We drove over an hour to come here and it did not disappoint. Will come back for sure! Please provide me a recommendation of what I should try next!"\
"Overall great food from the meatballs, octopus, pizza and all the pasta\
\
Octopus - probably one of the best in the city\
\
Mafalde Ai Funghi - best pasta at Gusto"\
No Same day reservations. Walk in only. The place was very busy. The ambiance of the place was cool and nice. It is a little loud since it's packed. The food is ok lot of other Italian restaurants with better food and cheaper option. The service was nice and friendly. The staff was always around when you needed it. The food came out quick as well. It's 1 washroom for both men and women, so that was a little surprising. The palce is nice to check it out.\
The mushroom pasta is a must when going here. The Brussels sprouts were also great. I would probably skip the tiramisu next time.\
Visited Toronto for a week and a local recommend this place to us. I am very glad she did! The food was delicious and the cocktails were mixed perfectly. Dana was our server and she made the experience so much better! She gave great recommendations and answered every question we had. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun atmosphere and great Italian food. Thank you Dana for taking such wonderful care of us!\
"We had an excellent experience at Gusto 101.\
\
The food, cocktails were great and the service was simply excellent.\
\
Josh was just incredible ! From drink and food recommendations to extremely quick service. Loved the  way in which things were done. Very well organized.\
\
As we love sea food Josh suggested we try the octopus and shrimp pasta both of which were amazing. we also tried spicy pizza and Nero salad which was amazing.\
\
Everything was simply awesome. We look forward to our next visit."\
First time coming here in a while, and everything tasted nice. We started off with the Burratta and focaccia anitpasti. For my main I went with the Mafalde Ai Funghi, which is a four mushroom pasta with a creamy truffle sauce. All the flavours came together well in the dish!\
Still an awesome place for good Italian food, but the famous Kale salad just didn't have the kick and taste that I remember from my visit years ago.\
"A solid pick for this neighborhood that has never disappointed me yet. Love the rooftop seating to catch up with friends over $1/oz house pours.\
\
My faves include:\
Carpaccio (melts in your mouth and the mushrooms are a great touch)\
Polipo (so tender and flavorful)\
Funghi pizza"\
Every time I go there I\'92d definitely have their Mafalde Ai Funghi \uc0\u55358 \u56697  The best funghi pasta in trt ever!! \u10084 \u65039 \u10084 \u65039 \u10084 \u65039 \
My favourite Italian restaurant in the city, we got the Cavolo Nero salad, lasagna and of course mafalde ai funghi, we always only get mafalde but we wanted to experience other dishes as well, the salad was very refreshing and lasagna was also delicious, but I would say Mafalde ai funghi was our favourite again\
Got the lamb meatballs (POLPETTE DI CARNE), mushroom pasta (MAFALDE AI FUNGHI), and the tiramisu. All three were absolutely delicious I\'92m already thinking about when I can go back again. The restaurant is nicely decorated and pretty dark with a candle-lit type of ambience. This combined with the food quality, I would confidently recommend this place to anyone looking for a gem downtown.\
This place was fantastic! First time at this gusto location but loved the ambiance, vibes. Perfect for date night and affordable!\
Hands-down the best pasta in Toronto. I'm not a vegetarian and I almost always need meat, but the mushroom pasta was just to die for. The seafood pasta was also very deculent. The only thing I'd pick on is the price point - but the taste makes up for it.\
On a trip to toronto and I wanted some italian food and a friend of mine sent me to this place, although it was very loud inside there was a nice vibe and decour all around, I ordered a pizza with salami and roasted peppers and my friend ordered there mushroom pasta, both were very enjoyable.\
"My second time here within 6 months  The food is good but service is very robotic. My total dining time from beginning to end was 35 minutes.\
\
The host makes it a priority to remind you of a seating time limit. The tables and chairs are crooked. Went early to a upstairs dining room at 10% capacity. I was declined a request to sit at a table of my choice\
\
Gusto 101 needs to address their wait staff. The team here is incapable of creating a welcoming, fun and enjoyable dining experience. No smiles and a very unwelcoming experience. I received fast food service at an Italian restaurant. I do not recommend this chain of restaurant."\
"This is a place for good Italian food.\
\
[Food] I ordered the Mafalde ai Funghi and it was delicious, the flavours all complimented each other reaching a crescendo of taste in harmony. I only wish the meal was larger so there would be more to enjoy.\
[Wine] I ordered a bottle of the house wine, it was smooth and I recommend it.\
[Atmosphere] I sat inside, but the patio is where you want to be."\
I enjoyed my dinner a lot. The bistec is one of the best I've had in Toronto.\
"The food at Gusto is amazing.\
The pizza is fantastic and the calamari is just perfect. I would have just loved if the portion of the calamari was more.\
\
The burger is juicy as hell."\
Food was amazing! We were lucky enough to get a reservation thanks to help of some friends!  If walking by on the street, you'd never really give gusto a second look, but once you're inside tasting the food, you understand why there is such a wait for this undercover restaurant. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the washroom situation.\
"This is my 8th time visit. Food is great ( as usual). The environment is amazing. But the server was a bit disappointing. He offered me take away box while the main dish just arrived. And while me and my friend were still chatting and enjoying our food, the server came and took my plate and gone (the server never checked on us).\
\
Overall experience, nice atmosphere and food."\
Good food quality \uc0\u55357 \u56397 , atmosphere\u55357 \u56397 , servers are friendly, no parking, a little bit over price in comparison to the portions size, kale salad and mafalde ai Funghi taste great and you can distinguish the balance in taste and how the chef is detail-oriented \u55357 \u56397 \
Amazing Italian food, good vibes and super friendly service.\
This is one of the best pastas I\'92ve ever tried! Mafalda al Funghi is a must. Definitely coming back.\
Mafalde Ai Funghi\uc0\u55357 \u56902 \u55356 \u57339 \u8205 \u9792 \u65039 (the mushroom cream sauce is average decent. But the pasta is superb, very chewy thick satisfying, amazing texture\
Fantastic dinner and service!! The pizzas had the perfect light and crisp dough but the crust still had bite to it. I loved the prosciutto and arugula pizza. The lamb meatballs were delicious and paired well with the cavalo nero (kale) salad we got. Great spot for authentic Italian food!\
"Went here for bfs birthday. In love with their mushroom pasta and lamb meatballs but they didn\'92t bring us any dessert or anything even though I made a reservation and said it was my bfs birthday.\
It didn\'92t matter that much to us but it just would\'92ve been nice. I really like the vibes here too.\
We also had pepperoni pizza and asked for extra pepperoni. It was great!"\
Standard food quality and options. Was unaware of the mandatory 20% tip though not saying that was hidden. The waitress emphasized (three times) that any extra tip would be appreciated. On the basis of a mandatory 20% we won\'92t return.\
Dinner was excellent. Split a salad, pizza, and main course with a friend. Food was perfectly prepared and relatively fast. Portions were reasonable. Drinks were delicious. Definitely on my list to return next time I'm in Toronto.\
Been to gusto a handful of times. Will continue to eat here whenever pasta cravings are present. I\'92d recommend the mushroom truffle pasta, delicious!\
"Dropped by for dinner on a Friday night. We only waited 10 mins before getting at lemon their gorgeous outdoor patio. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and it was apparently a garage for cars before and you can see some signs and decor items to reflect that. I loved it!\
The food was heavenly. So delicious. The portion size for the pasta was a bit smaller than that of the chicken plate. But the taste is superb. The waiter was very helpful and the service was fantastic. We also had olive oil cake at the end and it was very interesting and quite delicious!\
Highly recommended place and it\'92s a nice date night spot!"\
"I never post reviews\'85 I figured a waste of time but I eat out 3-4 times a week so I think I should start so I warn spenders where to go and not to go\'85..\
Gusto 101, Not impressed whatsoever Arrived at 5pm. Place was \'93empty\'94 down and upstairs and they still struggled to figure out where we could sit. Service was barely ok and food was barely 1 star at best maybe a negative. Pizza stunk on the bottom. Drinks were sub par. mushroom pasta was \'93crap\'94\'85. Chili oil was orange Where\'92s the oil and Chili? 6 of us spent $120/per person (1 bill) and were asked to leave in 1:45min. BTW, they force a tip for 6 person bill\'85. So I guess they don\'92t have to earn it. No thank you. Never again. Don\'92t bother to reply Guisto, never coming back."\
"The food was good , but definitely they need to improve how they treat their customers. They were rushing us while we still eating, they were complaining about the number of people in our table , but they didn\'92t gave us any solution!\
\
I only recommend this place if you are going in a group of 4 or less."\
"I recently visited Gusto101 and was incredibly disappointed with the service I received. The staff were incredibly rude and seemed to have no concern for the customer experience.\
\
Upon arriving, we were greeted with a cold and indifferent attitude from the host. The atmosphere of the restaurant was uninviting due to the rude staff. I will never be returning to this restaurant again due to the unpleasant experience.\
\
Staff should be completely retrained in customer service."\
Love the pasta very much. The shrimp is fresh and the sauce is amazing! Hope they provide basil-based source as well. The service is fab!\
I've previously visited their other sister restaurant (Trettoria Nervosa), and at both location visits, their funghi pasta was impeccable! Perfect texture, and well balanced richness to it! I don't think I will ever get tired of it! The variety of apps that we ordered was also very well made. The patio seating up top is very cute, nice casual space for a casual night out!\
"I was charged an extra 7$ to remove cheese from a pizza. They made me custom make a new pizza with less ingredients for 7$ more. I was told the pizza couldn\'92t be made without cheese as it would ruin the integrity of the pizza yet they made it anyways without mentioning they would charge differently for it? Since when does a pizza have integrity? If anything I should\'92ve had money deducted from reducing the ingredients for you. I didn\'92t say anything to my server because he was busy but it truly felt like a tactic to ramp up the bill and his hefty 20% auto grat. He seemed preoccupied and not wanting to be working. Skyler p( never introduced himself, I got this from my bill) Thank-you for the lack of communication and hospitality.\
I would not recommend this place to anyone. As a server I know how hard the job could be but how obvious it is when servers are being sneaky. I never want my customers to leave with an experience like the one I had. Unprofessional and underwhelming. Please Do better."\
I\'92ve been to Gusto 101 more times than I can count have have been a loyal customer for years. The food is always tasty and cooked perfectly. I went tonight with some friends as was very surprised at how small the portion sizes have gotten and was quite disappointed. The mafalde pasta and calamari were extremely small hardly enough for one person let alone for sharing. The sweet potato app was far to expensive for HALF a sweet potato.\
10/10 experience, the shrimp pasta is to die for!! I saw that gusto is famous for their mushroom truffle pasta. While I love a good truffle pasta, not the biggest fan of the texture of mushrooms. I asked my server if we could get it without the mushrooms and that's not really an option. So we went with our back up which was the shrimp pasta and our server hyped it up. For great reason btw, it was unreal! Pizza was great, nice and thin. Arancini could have used a bit more moisture and sauce. Service was also great, my server was really sweet with great recommendations and accommodated my allergies. Music and vibe was lovely. Would definitely recommend!!!\
Great vibes in this King west trendy restaurant! The food is simple but well executed and delicious, I personally love to stop by for a glass of vino and a pizza before starting the party :) great service too! Cheers\
Disappointing first experience. Initially, we realized that the online menu we reviewed prior to arrival is obsolete. Upon ordering, we simply requested the egg be hardboiled  (instead of a soft one) for one of the dishes (due to a medical condition), but the waitress couldn't accommodate. So we ended up leaving and enjoyed our brunch somewhere else.\
Worst experience ever with the manager. My friends started dinner before us. We ended up meeting them afterwards. They charged us 20% tip on the bill (large party) without ever mentioning it or having it written on the physical menu. They told us it was written online but they gave us the paper menu ??? We had an amazing service from the waiter, but when it came to talking with the manager about this issue he kept heavily arguing with us. Never in my life was I disrespected like this by a manager at a restaurant. Not only did he have 0 empathy, but he also had 0 consideration. We tried to end the argument but he kept insisting that not paying the 20% would be rude. We would\'92ve given a great tip to our server, but being forced to do so with no notice AND being argued so intensely by the manager made us regret going there. If I could give 0 stars to the manager only I would.\
Wasn\'92t really my first choice. I like space and booth, etc, there is not much room at least in the winter. Wasn\'92t a fan of Arancini, but maybe I don\'92t understand it. The Diavola pizza was very nice. Thin, but a good size. Just the right amount of spice. By the end of the pizza I was in a good mood and ordered desserts. Tiramisu was amazing. 5/5. Coffee was very good too. Come for the pizza and the desserts, skip Arancini! Decent price. It was worth it. Good service too.\
Food  and service was amazing but ambience could be much better.\
my boyfriend and I went for dinner at 5pm. we got the kale caesar to share, i had the mushroom pasta, he had lasagna, and we got the tiramisu for dessert. everything was delicious! our server Nick was very attentive, knowledgeable, and had great recommendations. he elevated the night for us and made our experience that much better. we had excellent service and it was a cozy romantic spot for an early valentine\'92s day dinner.\
"Absolutely love love love Gusto 101! I haven't been here in years and always told my husband how delicious their Mafalde ai Funghi was and was so pleased to know it still lives up to my memory and expectation!\
\
We also ordered the arancini, a lovely deep fried rice ball filled with mozzarella, pleasantly flavoured with saffron, served on a mildly spicy tomato sauce and finished with lots of Parmigiano Reggiano. The Margherita pizza was delicious, perfectly leopard chewy crust, strong tomato flavoured sauce, mozzarella and finished with pecorino and basil. Lastly, we had the cannoli - it was an absolute delight!\
\
Service was fantastic. All around, loved and still love Gusto!"\
"Recently came to Gusto to try the  brunch. Absolutely blown away at how good the Ricotta Lemon Blueberry pancakes were. Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of toppings. Enjoyed it right down to the last bite!\
\
I did come here long time ago for dinner and recall having the octopus & fungi pasta which were also great and still menu items!"\
"Craving comfort food, what\'92s that pasta you say. Gusto has you covered with some delicious treats and refreshing drinks or wine by the ounce by the dollar. The pesto was a standout dish, it was fresh, light, and the pasta perfectly held the sauce. From what we were told it\'92s a new addition to the menu moving off the featured list to a permanent spot on the main menu, a must try!\
\
Gusto has two patios, one being on the ground level and the other being from the second floor providing an elevated view of the neighbourhood. The rooftop patio also has interesting features created from the skylights of the building.\
\
The restaurant serves well for most occasions such as birthdays, dates, business dinners or lunches, or just an evening out. Our server was knowledgeable and gave good service with a energetic approach.\
\
The atmosphere of the restaurant is lively with music and people talking, however, we did not find it too loud at all as we were able to carry on a conversation without trouble. With that said we did lunch there so it might be different in the evenings.\
\
Whether out for a lunch\'92s to catch up with old friends or on an evening out to impress, Gusto has you covered!"\
"This place was the biggest let down we\'92ve had in a while. My wife suggested that we go here based on reviews she read online. I\'92m certain those reviews are either written by people who don\'92t know better or publicity.\
\
The first thing that was off was the atmosphere and decor of the place. I was expecting some kind of upscale sit down experience for some reason, but instead this place had more of a fast food chain restaurant vibe. The music was blasting loud and it was dancehall gangsta reggae the entire time. It\'92s possible that I misread the reviews online when they said \'93the atmosphere was welcoming,\'94 because they could have been written by very young people who welcome the loud dance club yelling to hear each other speak type of vibe.  I couldn\'92t understand why an Italian place would have dancehall music blasting, not that I dislike the music it just felt off and it made my 1 year old daughter uncomfortable.\
\
The food was not at all what I expected.\
\
Appetizer, bread (focaccia) it was wet and dripping in some oil. I don\'92t think it was olive oil or butter, I didn\'92t like it. I think it was too wet on the outside and not spongy in the inside. It was crummy inside so it was just not my taste.\
\
Appetizer, octopus in squid ink, the ink sauce was actually very good, the octopus portion was really small and truthfully I didn\'92t get any flavour from the octopus it was all coming from the sauce.\
\
Main, truffle pasta, my mind was just blown by how disappointing this item was. It was supposed to be a \'93must try\'94 on the reviews. It was very salty and the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it had clumped into some kind of gooey salty combination that was not palatable. The pasta tasted bitter for some reason too so I have no idea if that was the intention by the kitchen.\
\
Entre, pizza margherita, overcooked and dry at the bottom but not bad tasting.\
\
The last thing that made our experience unpleasant was the service. The service wasn\'92t attentive to our needs and they all seemed to be in a rush. I was still in the middle of eating when my server came over to ask me if I was done and wanted some boxes to pack up. I literally had food in my mouth when she came to ask me that. I hate it when servers do that.\
\
If you go to this place then expectations should be set accordingly. It\'92s a fast food place for young people to come and drink plus have a choice of food. Also I can see this being a good place to bring a date if you\'92re a young guy on a budget. It\'92s not a family friendly place, and honestly I think Scaddabush is superior to this place if we are to compare a similar restaurant."\
Calamarata pasta was amazing! Burger was definitely too salty \'85\
We visited toronto this weekend and we were extremely disappointed with our experience at Gusto. After waiting 20 minutes for someone to come and see us for drinks in the beginning, we were surprised at the end by an imposed 20% tip fee on our bill because we were 5 people. Absolutely no one mentioned any fixed tips for groups and nothing was mentioned on the physical menu (it was written in the fine prints of the internet menu, but very unlikely to see). We usually give very good tips and don\'92t mind doing so when having a good service, however not being told from the beginning and having a surprise when receiving the bill is what really bothered us. The manager came to see us and was very rude by saying we were the ones disrespecting him, kept arguing and said they intentionally don\'92t voice the group fixed tip because its a \'93bad look\'94 for the business. I\'92ve never experienced anything like this from a manager, unbelievable!! We went to another restaurant the next day and the manager was nice enough to warn us right off the bat about the group tip, now that\'92s appropriate and transparent customer service.\
"I was looking for some great Italian places to try out in Toronto and this place caught my attention. The reservation is recommended here. We missed our reservation. So, we had to sit in patio area on the roof near the bar. The other option was to wait for 45 mins. The place has a dim lit kind of ambience. The staff is very well trained and is very friendly.\
\
Now, coming to food, we started with Tuscan fries and Mushroom Bruschetta. Fries were crispy and then Bruschetta just tasted amazing. In Mains, we tried their famous Truffle Mushroom Pasta and Melanzane Pizza. Both dishes just tasted heavenly. The base of Pizza was very thin and full of cheese. The Pasta was creamy and so yummy. We ended our meal with their Chocolate Cake and Tiramisu. Both of them were really good, especially the Tiramisu one. Overall, a great place to try some amazing Italian food. But it is a little costly. So, it might burn your pockets a little bit."\
"I swear Toronto has the best rooftop patios/bars and this restaurant is one of them. Gusto 101 is a a beautiful restaurant located in downtown Toronto. My friend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. There wasn\'92t even a queue to get in, which was a pleasant surprise.\
\
The restaurant\'92s dinning area is split into two levels. We sat upstairs in their gorgeous rooftop area, it kind of reminded me of a greenhouse. The service here was great as well. Our waiter was polite and very attentive.\
\
I ordered a mimosas ($11 I think) and the eggs in purgatorio which came with a side of grilled sourdough bread with a spicy tomato like sauce on top. The meal was delicious! The flavor was perfect! The eggs do come runny which I normally don\'92t like but went really well with this meal. I\'92d definitely recommend trying this place out! There dinner menu looks just as yummy especially if you\'92re in the mood for Italian."\
The restaurant is highly recommended. The dishes are relatively in small portion, but good for one person. The mushroom creamy pasta for lunch is really good and not on the menu, but available all the time upon request. The avocado toast is just so so. We also ordered eggs in purgatorio which is good too. The tomato sauce is spicy on top of toasts, with grilled cheese.\
Amazing food.  Excellent vibe!! The octopus and the tartare are a must.  Service was great.  We loved the mushroom pasta.  The pizza was very good.  I think we'll be getting the same exact order the next time we go here.\
One of my favorite restaurants! The mafalde ai funghi is my absolute favorite, a delicious must try for any mushroom/truffle lovers! Also tried the calamari and the arancini, both really tasty as well. The staff are always super friendly and the atmosphere is  lively but intimate.\
"Gusto is always an amazing experience! The quality of the food, the taste, and the vibe of the venue is spectacular. No need to mention that the staff are super friendly.\
\
Will definitely come back - always!"\
"The service here was exceptional!!!\
We made reservations and were super glad we did. Our table was one of the only free ones left and there was a wait at the door.\
We ate on their screened rooftop patio, which was quite nice. The decor is fun, but cramped. The chairs are pretty uncomfortable.\
The kitchen was super amazing and made me a personal pasta when I wasn\'92t overly excited about their singular vegan option. The pasta was exceptional!!\
The husband had a meatball pizza which he graded as his second favourite pizza of all time! The drinks were so-so, but strong!\
\
We will 100% be returning!"\
Gusto has been my favorite Italian restaurant in the city since it opened.  Always consistent, never disappoints.  Amazing pizzas, pastas and affordable wine.  Highly recommend.\
Had a fantastic time with friends there.  It felt like we were in New York.  It was crowded and noisy, but full of energy and atmosphere.  The food was great.  The staff were really friendly and attentive.. and the wine on tap was better than I thought it would be.  Would definitely recommend and come back.\
Great Italian restaurant. The food was delicious and nicely presented. Service was great as was the ambience. The space is unique and has the options of sitting outside on their patio, the dimly lit intimate first floor and a more open concept for the 2nd floor. I can see why this restaurant is so popular, highly recommend it.\
"The food is good and a great environment. Service was fast and quick. $1/oz of house wine and the patio are another two reasons that makes this place. A little too loud to carry conversations especially if the roof is closed.\
\
We had the risotto balls, mushroom bruschetta, and mushroom pasta.  I love mushrooms but if you're not a fan I'd avoid the three dishes."\
We came here for lunch and sat on the second floor, it was very warm and bright despite it being a chilly winter day. The atmosphere is very lovely and its definitely a louder place for brunch. The food was really good, everything felt new and exciting and wasn't too heavy that we couldn't walk after.\
"Ordered take out on a Saturday night. Inside was busy.\
\
Ordered the Diavola pizza, which comes with sun-dried tomato pesto with calabrese salami and roasted peppers. Slightly disappointed as by the time we ate it was cold already and the dough was chewy. So this doesn't travel well as we weren't far away. It's also got a slight kick so that was enjoyable.\
\
My favorite was Mafalde Al Funghi. Portabello and oyster mushrooms with a truffle cream sauce. Very tasty and was really good."\
My Gusto experience was amazing! The rooftop was a vibe, the wine recommendation was spot on and the food was DELICIOUS! Highly recommend this restaurant.\
The place was spacious and had a good rustic vibe. Loved the carpaccio, lasagna, and wine. We were also given a free glass of sparkling wine because it was new years eve.\
Spacious Italian bistro serving up the delicious classics - pasta, pizza and grill meat. I\'92m also particularly impressed by their Amaro cocktail list and the beautiful space upstairs with lots of natural light. Check out this Toronto classic when you are in the area :).\
"A good go to spot when in downtown Toronto.\
\
Definitely a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum as you\'92ll most likely run between $30 to $50 on average.\
\
The food never disappoints. Good selection, a little bit of everything. They also have daily specials.\
\
Favourites are all the pastas, with special shout out to the Mushroom pasta. It is a must have.\
\
Their pizzas are pretty good as well.\
\
Weekdays, it\'92s relatively easy to get a spot, but I\'92d always recommend a reservation if possible."\
Beautiful place. Delicious espresso. Amazing service. Great brunch. Cool atmosphere. Balcony was dope. Waiters were attentive. Downfall was the pizza but I just came back from Rome so I may be bias.\
The food was so good but what made this dining experience even better is syd! Great service and she made the best food and drink suggestions\'85 thanks girl!!! Will come back just for her\
This place serves excellent Italian food. We ordered Tagliata di Manzo, the Omelette. Both of them were delicious. The steak in Tagliata di Manzo was quite tasty was cooked perfect to my liking. I especially loved the bacon in this dish, which has nice smokiness to it. We also ordered the Mushroom Bruschetta, and they were great. I\'92m somewhat carnivore and loved this \uc0\u55357 \u56843 . To close the meal, we ordered the Tiramisu, and this was also great. I thought it was sweet but not too sweet, which is perfect. This could\'92ve been a 5 star experience, but unfortunately we were a little disappointed that it was Brunch menu only on Sunday afternoon. The menu on their site indicated about this under \'93Brunch Menu\'94 but not \'93Lunch & Dinner\'94. We didn\'92t realize weekend lunch is brunch only and wasn\'92t prepared for it. \u55357 \u56853 \
Since moving to Toronto in 2018, Gusto has ranked consistently as one of my favourite restaurants. Their signature mafaldi funghi is to die for. Fabulous pizzas and burgers as well. Highly recommended, the quality and taste of the food leaves you with a memorable experience of flavours.\
"Easily one of my favourite patios to date. Multi leveled restaurant with space to spare, street level patio as well as a rooftop patio, delicious food, and $1/oz house wine.\
\
The place itself strikes a balance between casual and classy without feeling stuffy. Although the food is a little on the pricier side, you can rest easy knowing that you're getting quality food and attentive service.\
\
We went at about the early lunch hour and stayed throughout the lunch rush and honestly, it was great the whole time. Never felt like our server left us hanging and the food/drink always arrived promptly.\
\
Again, wish the food wasn't so expensive but it's definitely a worthy splurge once in a while."\
Such a great brunch spot! A ton of great food options and a really great atmosphere. It can get pretty busy depending on when you\'92re planning on dining so I would suggest making reservations if possible. The coffee is delicious as is the food! They have and upstairs covers patio, a lower patio, and inside dinning! A must try!\
Absolutely the best pasta I have ever had. Great atmosphere. A must have if you are craving Italian in Downtown Toronto.\
Lunch with my girlfriends last week! Didn\'92t disappoint. Burger was average but everything else including fries were outstanding! Kale salad and burrata to die for!!! Great thin crust pizza!\
Amazing experience! I've been here 3 times now and it's not a coincidence that there're rated so high. The food is consistent,  service is excellent, it's in the heart of Toronto, and the atmosphere is great! I highly recommend the mushroom pasta and the mushroom bruschetta. Dessert? Go with the cannoli (I didn't have it but my co-worker said it was amazing)!!\
Amazing natural light and delicious funghi pasta.\
Brutally bad host. I came in to meet friends here for drinks, and the restaurant was less than half full. We asked for a table, and the host literally sneered at us and told us we couldn't have a table unless we ordered food. We agreed to order food, and he sneered at us AGAIN. As a visitor in the city, I was pretty appalled by the attitude of the host. The wait staff was nice and efficient, food was solid. Would not return, though.\
Service was good. They have a brunch menu until 4pm on Sunday\'92s which we did not realize. There is only one pasta available during this time however the pasta was really good. Fennel sausage pizza was okay. Tiramisu was good but I think the highlight of the meal was the truffle pasta.\
Lovely spot/patio for Italian food! The malfade ai funghi is fantastic! My dish didn't come out hot unfortunately but even then it still tasted so good. I can't wait to go back to try it hot and fresh out of the pan/pot. For mushroom lovers, this is for you. The pasta was thick and cooked perfectly.\
"Love this place !! This is the best rooftop patio in Toronto.\
\
We had an office party on the roof and the overall service and experience was wonderful. Food was delicious as always.\
The new cocktails were really good. Must try the spicy mango margarita.\
\
The best part of all was the service.\
Our server Joshua was 11/10 for providing a pleasant memorable experience. Great suggestions for drinks, extremely quick and very patient with a few of my sometimes annoying buddies haha.\
But as a group we just wanted to give Joshua a shout out for being so accommodating and providing top class service on what looked like an extremely busy night.\
\
We will be back soon! Thank you Gusto !"\
Great food, amazing atmosphere and friendly staff. Tried a few different things and they were all delicious. The food came pretty quickly even though the place was packed. The wine they have on tap was pretty delicious as well, the red one anyway. Bon appetit!!\
Great ambience and decor but long wait times. They do offer a floor level and a rooftop patio. We asked for rooftop patio seats, waited 1.5hrs and then were given a floor level seat. We ordered 2 pizzas and 1 pasta. One of our pizzas was completely burnt and both had minimal sauce. All dished lacked in flavor, serving sizes are very small and prices are expensive. The food does not justify the price but the location might make up for it.\
Really nice ambiance. They have a nice patio out in front and in the back. Also serve wine by the ounce which is great. The prices are a little expensive for Italian food and the portions not the biggest. I often order the bucatini pasta which the most recent time I was there was a small portion. Service is good and pizza and kale salad is very tasty. They don't take reservations and there can often be a long wait.\
Disappointed by the food this go round. Caesar salad was bitter and cacio pepe had too much black pepper which overpowered the flavor. Service was great but be prepared to yell to have a convo since tables were so close together\
"Arrived at 6:45pm on a Thursday, seated at 7:45.\
\
5/5 food\
The burger was good but the fries were amazing - excellent crunch and flavourful aioli!\
The funghi pasta was rich and had a nice chewy texture.\
The tiramisu was a good portion and was shareable between 3 people.\
House wine is $1/oz which is great value!\
\
3/5 service\
Our server, although friendly, was not very attentive. We found it difficult to get his attention and ended up staying longer than anticipated due to the constant waiting."\
Delicious Italian cuisine! Food was executed very well, and served fairly quickly considering it was busy. Price points are reasonable for the quality, and service was tentative. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Only complaint is the space can be a little tight, but it was manageable.\
Mafalde is their most popular and tastiest dish! I found the risotto Verde to be too sour. Portion sizes have certainly decreased VS pre-pandemic. Drinks are average and very expensive. Be sure to order their delicious house wine.... Not shown on the menu.\
The service did not start off well... my colleague received his drink before the table got our waters? The plates also were dirty and slightly oily. Also when our mains came, they didn\'92t ask if we wanted anything (i.e. ground pepper, chilli flakes or chilli oil) until we asked and the waiter literally looked confused. Apart from that, overall love the resto, the one waiter that knew what was going on recommended us some options etc - very informative. The food quality and the portions were great (we were very full leaving), we ordered the kale salad, grilled octopus app, mushroom pasta (must try!!), and a steak with a side of broccoli.\
Fantastic Italian and a really cool dining atmosphere, with open kitchen. Cacio e Pepe and Amatriciana were delicious and tiramisu was lovely. Portion sizes were a little small, but that just meant we actually had room for dessert \uc0\u55357 \u56837 \
The food is SO good (although I found the pizza too tough to cut through with the tools provided) and the venue itself is adorable. We didn't get the opportunity to sit outside, but I would highly recommend it - inside is way too loud. Service is great and prices are appropriately steep. Be prepared to dish out at least $50 per person.\
Came with a group of friends. Service was quick and pleasant however the food was mediocre. We enjoyed the pepperoni pizza but the sausage one with the dandelion greens wasn't very good.\
"Gusto, Gusto, Gusto!!!\
I've been here twice in the past two weeks and I am floooooooooooooored. I had the Arancini, Marg pizza, tried the Lasagna and I had the Mushroom Truffle Pasta. ALLLLLLL 10/10 Dishes to order. I know whenever I come to Gusto I will never be disappointed, I just wish y'all stayed open later!\
I'll be back a million times <3 ALSO Ambiance here was wild good, great service and great people!"\
Never a dull moment at Gusto! Their mushroom creamy pasta is heavenly and gotta love their $1/oz house wine!!! Always friendly and attentive service, great atmosphere and beautiful place. One of my all time fave spots downtown Toronto!\
Modern decor paired with a unique building make for a great location for a trendy restaurant. Cocktail selection is diverse and the bartenders are inventive when working off the preset drink list. Only 1 beer was offered when I was there, however they have another that was sold out. Food is very very good but not worthy of a perfect 5/5, and we did try almost everything on the preset menu. They do not allow for swapping of accompaniments, which was annoying. It's a great place to go to, and according to people have been before brunch might be more worthy of repeat visits.\
"Love the rustic, automotive industry feel decor to the place. Great set up from the ground floor to the upstairs (patio) area. Be sure to ask to go upstairs to scout out some seats.\
\
Great in house wine to go with any meal on the menu.\
\
Servers were all attentive to finished dishes and our waiter was super knowledgeable.  Portion of food can be bigger, but quality over quantity ; the food itself was delish."\
We walked in on a Sunday during peak brunch hours and were seated right away, though the patio was completely full. Despite being busy, our food came out quickly. The avocado toast seemed small when it first came out, but it is very filling. My partner had the sausage pizza - perfectly cooked, not too greasy and as he put it, the right ratio of cheese and crust.\
This place is super popular..dim lights, rustic ambiance, lots of people...that being said...the food was really good. i had the mushroom pasta it was delicious...you know when u just want some good pasta and a nice glass of wine...this is your spot...oh the greens side dish was yumm...the panna cotta was a little bit of summer in a jar...the chocolate cake was sooo good u can taste the quality chocolate the used...I was underwhelmed by the tiramisu surprisingly.\
Amazing food. The pizza was a little burnt than I expected.\
"Great spot for a group! The upstairs is fabulous. The staff is friendly. Food is a solid three stars:\
\
Negronis are tasty. Sangria is a bit too sweet.\
\
Beef carpaccio was fresh but overwhelmed by the truffle oil.\
\
The kale salad was light but it could use more of the other ingredients... we added avocado and wanted more of the pine nuts and currants. It was really just a pile of kale.\
\
The pizzas were surprisingly good, thin chewy crust, lots of stringy cheese.\
\
Shishitos were the usual, well blistered, topped with chili powder maybe? A slightly unique take that leveled them up a bit.\
\
Octopus was a bit soft, I wanted a little more texture or caramelization, but it was really good."\
Loved the place and their food. That's what I call an Italian restaurant. Friendly staff reasonable price. My first time and didn't had any idea what to get but they helped.. so loved their service...will go again.\
Really good food! Would go again :)\
Loved it here! Went for my first time and overall excellent food, service and atmosphere! I definitely recommend to sit at the bar upstairs if you want a great view. Plus there\'92s wine on tap here \uc0\u55357 \u56845  must try is the rose \u55357 \u56397 \u55356 \u57341 \
Unique restaurant with a glass roof and seating along the kitchen. Amazing food and their house wine on tap is pretty good and well worth the $1 an oz price point! Absolutely love that they serve mulled wine as well!\
"Food is dependably good. The pizza is decent, the salads are excellent and the small selection of pastas are very nicely done. In the summer the front patio or rooftop are fantastic.\
\
It's a pretty popular place though and fills up fast. So if you're going for lunch make sure you get there by noon or you may not get a seat."\
"Visited this place last week! Was packed on a weekday dinner!\
\
Tried all the pastas on the menu, their mushroom pasta was a killer! Damnnn! Must try item!\
\
Other pastas were great tooo!\
\
Staff was really friendly and helpful!"\
I loved the mafalde ai funghi! Definitely a must have here. The pizza diavola wasn\'92t bad but wasn\'92t special either. The tiramisu was good too! We got their Sunday special lasagna for takeout and it was really good!\
We've really enjoyed dining here. This place is vibrant with people and energy, the food is exceptional and the service is great for a place this busy. Definitely a place to visit on your trip to Toronto. The burrata was flavorful and the pizzas here are to die for.\
"This place has a Really great roof top patio especially on sunny day..! \uc0\u55357 \u56846 \u55357 \u56846 \u55357 \u56846 \
Nice and polite servers treats you. We ordered burger, pizza and spaghetti. Tastes are really good.  We all liked the burger the most.  Actually , these were good combination for three shared food. \uc0\u55357 \u56843 \u55357 \u56843 \u55357 \u56843 \
Althogh it was lunch time at work, but we enjoyed and had a good time."\
Good food! I love the vibe of the place as well\
"We had a blast!\
There's something for everyone on this menu! From gluten free, to vegan, to vegetarian, to no restrictions, there's an option for you.\
Highly recommend the endive salad to start and the cauliflower main dish. I will for sure be making that salad at home, thanks for the idea.\
My friends had pasta, octopus, fries, salads and pizza and everyone raved about their meals.\
Service was excellent.\
Follow them on Instagram: @gusto101to\
Reso recommended. You can book online, or call.\
Can't wait to come back in the summer to sit on that patio."\
This place was fantastic! First time going there, I was there for the dinner time. Busy place but we were seated right away at about 5:30 pm. Food didn\'92t take a long time at all and tasted amazing! Tried the pizza and the mushroom pasta and loved it. The customer service was awesome as well. I recommend this place and will definitely be back again soon.\
Can you really say anything besides amazing things about Gusto 101? NO! The food and service never disappoint! They have an amazing wine list, so if you\'92re on the fence between a glass and splitting a full bottle with someone, go for the bottle! Always worth it here!! \uc0\u9829 \u65039 \u9829 \u65039 \
"Good atmosphere and good taste of food!\
The octopus was really good and well combination with the three different sauces. I haven\'92t had a good quality of pasta before. Gusto\'92s truffle pasta was amazing and delicious. My friend ordered arancini as well, it\'92s bit salty for me, but still tasty.\
Server was so so. The server who was in charge of our table was bit slow and cold, but not bad."\
The seating felt cramped. The lighting was horrible on the top floor South window wall. It kept going in and out which was very frustrating. The waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. The 44 oz steak and 3 green sides were delicious along with the sour dough bread we dipped in steak juices. Overall, great experience.\
The food and service was great however we were a bit disappointed as the menu on their site (lunch and dinner) was not offered at the time we went (1pm). We had to choose from the brunch menu after having reviewed their lunch menu and having our hearts set on items that was not offered in their brunch menu. Their site doesnt indicate what time these menus range from either, else we wouldve gone at a later time.\
\{applies to lunch\} Tasty, quick modern Italian food served up in a trendy setting. Great selection of menu options for both the carnivores and vegetarians in your group. Salads are delicious and well-portioned, burgers and steaks are cooked to perfection. Pizzas are tasty and are best eaten "New York" style (folded in on themselves). A good option for a quick business lunch or date.\
"Delicious pancakes on the brunch menu! I would definitely get them again. They were the right amount of sweet, soft, and fluffy.\
\
The Cocoa Bowl wasn\'92t amazing nor worth $13. It was just yogurt, seeds, a few grapes, and some nuts. I feel like I should have tried something else on the menu, since there are better options."\
The food is just great. My wife and I had the escarole salad, pizza with mortadella and pistachio, lentils and handmade bread. Everything was super delicious. They also have a good selection of wines. The staff is very nice and friendly. We sat at the bar and it was really a great experience. We also found out that Gusto101 is is the same family of Trattoria Nervosa. Another amazing place to try in Yorkville. These are must-try place.\
Casual place for delicious Italian! It\'92s on the pricier side but the food is delicious. Portions are slightly on the smaller side. Highly recommend their funghi pasta, the kale salad, and their pizzas!\
Very nice restaurant, when weather approves try and go on the terrace on the second floor, it is well worth it for the atmosphere. The brunch menu is fantastic, can't go wrong with any choices. The waiter was also very accommodating.\
I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit because you cannot go wrong with $1 oz house wines! Pizzas, pastas, salads are all consistently delicious here. Eat the pizzas while they're hot because the slices do not hold up!\
I absolutely loved this place. Found a seat on the amazing patio. The staff was super friendly and made every effort to get the order right. The pizza was one of the best ones I have ever had. It was a well done authentic pizza! The Cannoli ordered as a dessert was crunchy and had an amazing flavour. Over all the experience was worth it and i would definitely recommend this place!\
"This was my second time at Gusto 101 while visiting Toronto - reserved ahead of time.\
Staff was friendly and helpful.\
I brought my 9 month old boy and didn\'92t expect them to have seating for him so I was prepared to have him on my lap throughout dinner. To my surprise they offered to install a lobster chair for him which fit him perfectly.\
\
What\'92s to say about the food- delicious! Every last bit of it.\
We ordered the Buratta, Brussel Sprouts, Mafalde Al Fungi, and Risotto Verde\
Everything was spectacular. Mafalde Al Fungi is by far my favourite of all time. So good that I ordered it to-go the next day.\
\
Worth trying this restaurant! Hope it stays forever."\
"Gusto 101 seems to just be shy of the 5 star mark.\
\
The food is really good , the atmosphere is really good, the price is alright, and the service is great. The restaurant seems to just be missing that one piece of the puzzle to make it a mind blowing restaurant. Being located in Toronto, there's stiff competition and I feel Gusto fits right in. It doesn't stand out, good or bad.\
\
The natural lighting is a welcoming site, and the brunch options are well varied, however, this isn't something that you couldn't get elsewhere.\
\
The pistachio pizza was a bit dry, and plain. The pasta that was touted as the best thing ever, was small and ordinary.\
\
This place will be a great place to catch up with friends, and if you can let that distract you from some of the missed opportunities on your plate, it will be an enjoyable experience."\
Good spot in the Entertainment District for Italian fusion cuisine. The atmosphere and ambiance here is upbeat and upscale. Service is great and the food is good - you'll be paying premium-level prices for decent food. Try making a reservation for groups and arrive early - seating here tends to fill up relatively quickly. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area!\
Lovely space, lots of sunlight, delicious food and great service. I ordered their popular MAFALDE AI FUNGHI pasta dish and it was \uc0\u55357 \u56856 \u55358 \u56612 \u55358 \u56688 \u55357 \u56845  so delicious. I was worried that it was just hyped up BUT it wasn\'92t :)\
The lasagna was excellent. The desserts were so tasty. Good service. Make a reservation!\
The food was phenomenal! Great atmosphere!\
Really really good service. Everything was amazing from start to finish. Had scallops, mushroom pasta and steak. Except I'm not describing as eloquently.  Perfectly paired with a red. So damn good. Amazing setting. Great bathrooms even.\
I love this place almost as much as I love its sister restaurant - Yorkville's Nervosa. As with Nervosa, the food here is consistently delicious and I very much enjoy the Gavi by the glass. Try the mafalde al fungi or the Rigatoni Bolognese. Both excellent pastas!\
Food was great but our server wasn't too friendly. Really cute place and nice ambience\
"Actually the best restaurant for go weekends in normal day on summer.\
Gusto 101 is fresh,  nice food and for talk with your friends or family is spacious.\
\
At least, i don't have bad critic for this place.\
\
On weekends you can drink fresh drinks and enjoy the food."\
We came here tonight for dinner. Everything we ordered was delicious! They have great cocktails and wines too. Be sure to try the Lamb Bolognese and Buratta, you\'92ll be in for a treat.\
"Came here on a Tuesday night for what was our 3rd time but this time it was for my girlfriends birthday. We were very excited as always to come to gusto as we have enjoyed the Mafalde Al Funghi, however our visit got off to the wrong foot as we requested a specific empty corner booth in the corner (the whole row was pretty empty as well) but the hostess said it was only for bigger parties. This makes no sense because they don\'92t take any reservations and the same middle section they say is available for us had the same amount of seating where a group of 4 could\'92ve sat. Both booth and other tables could seat a group of 4 but they didn\'92t let us sit at the booth.\
\
We were offered to sit up stairs at first but it was far too busy and loud for a date like dinner so we opted for a middle seat on the ground floor right by the kitchen. Throughout our night no one sat at the booth which we had originally requested (even though they said someone called but on their website and phone they at no reservations and only accept walk ins). Whatever, our waiter wasn\'92t the most personable or relatable, did what he had to do but didn\'92t make any extra effort to make our night special. Didn\'92t have a conversation. Anti social.\
\
Our Mafalde Al Funghi was just alright, it had been much more tastier before, something was missing. Seemed the pasta was hard not soft. I asked the waiter if he could do some special surprise for my GF he suggested cannoli or tiramisu, I said cannoli. I had a feeling this wouldn\'92t be free so I was okay with it but I didn\'92t think it would be $12, that\'92s fine but a warning would be nice. This is more of a heads up.\
\
Overall, I think we will give gusto another chance perhaps in the summer but for now it left a kind of bad impression where we will look for other restaurants for our pasta cravings."\
Good service. The grilled octopus was so yummy! The olive sauce that came with it was my favorite. This is the first place I was served Peroni beer in a tall beer glass, which I very much appreciated. Also, the pappardelle was delicious.\
"Its been my 4th visit to Gusto and it's always been amazing.\
\
Our server Josh has served me for the third time and he has always been excellent!!!!!\
Loved the new cocktails that Josh suggested.\
\
We also tried out a few new dishes this time and they were all amazing. Highly recommend the grilled octopus and the spec pizza."\
"Had experience of this place at 3 O'clock on Tuesday with 6 other people. The place having a great vibe even it wasn't crowded at that moment u could easily feel this place is a go to.\
We didn't had reservations but still they managed to give us a great place.\
Food us good, and great verity of Italian food.\
Calamaru was fresh and tasty. Risotto could be better but it was really good. Really recommend steak and the fish if u really into it."\
Nice atmosphere and service. The house wine was a great deal and great bang for buck. The mushroom pasta was a 5/5 and I would definitely come back to eat it again. The pizza was ok, the dough was too crunchy and a bit burned. I wouldn't come back for pizza.\
I was expecting the high price and happy to enjoy the quality that would come with it. Although, sadly the pizza was burnt on the bottom and the sauce was not even that tasty. As soon as if finished and said I didn\'92t want to look at dessert the waiter brought over the cheque and I felt very unwanted.\
The Polipo was excellent. Great texture and a diverse variety of sauces that combined to give a colorful explosion of flavour. The very popular Mafalda ai Funghi was rich and creamy. Great first bite - got a bit heavier after each successive bite. The Asissi cocktail was citrusy, light, and refreshing, counterpointed with the bite of lavendar from the sprigs. Will be back to try the famous kale salad and other dishes. Great service, cool decor and ambiance.\
"We traveled into Toronto for the weekend from NY and were seeking a modern Italian cuisine. Gusto 101 exceeded our expectations for a number of reasons. The wait was approximately 45min which gave us plenty of time to explore the surrounding neighborhood which we enjoyed. We were quickly seated after arriving back. Once ordered, dinner arrived sooner than expected and was phenomenal both in taste and presentation. Further, our server Benjamin was incredible. He not only offered helpful insight for our weekend vacation stay but went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful experience. On the way out, we accidentally left our helpful map our hotel provided but Benjamin ran out and chased us halfway down the street to return it!\
\
We highly recommend and will be sure to return upon our next visit!"\
Such great vibes and delicious Italian food. Portions are scattered in size. Pasta small, pizza big but everything tastes delicious.\
Great menu and great vibe. Food quality is superb. Love going there every time I\'92m in Toronto and the area has lots to offer.\
"The entrees were good. I'll give 4 out of 5 for main dishes.\
Good service. The place was a bit loud but that's fine.\
Panino al Gelato was very good ( pistachio ice cream sandwich )."\
Food arrived quick, well packaged and very hot! Utensils were written on the receipt but were forgotten so I had to eat with a plastic knife in my car. But overall the mafalde ai funghi was good. Pasta cooked al dente, sauce was flavourful.\
My girlfriend and I both really enjoyed our meal, had a difficult time picking between menu items they all sounded really good. Service was really good, could have been quicker but enjoyed the patio. Would definitely go back. Next door there is a really nice flower shop Portland Market, both are worth checking out.\
"The food here is absolutely amazing. The service is great and the vibe is nice. The food is a bit pricey but it is worth the money!\
I recommend the mushroom pasta!"\
Busy super busy restaurant. But good and courteous service, food is good...  Italian based cuisine. Good wine selection, downside it can be really loud...\
"Tried a bunch of different pizzas. All of them were very good.\
Atmosphere was very nice, the upstairs is a great place to sit during the afternoon hours.\
Canolies we\'92re overpriced and not flavourful.\
Would come again, but only for pizza."\
Food was delicious, bold flavors and the dishes are well portioned. On the more expensive side but by not much. The ambiance is nice and service is friendly and responsive. Very busy so reservations are recommended for larger groups or if you want to be upstairs.\
Hands down best Italian restaurant in Toronto. The truffle pasta is delicious along with everything else I\'92ve tried on the menu.\
Top place. An old garage renovated 7 years ago. The grilled squid is excellent. The barmen are extremmy kind. Everything is good there.\
"Gusto 101 is a Toronto staple! If you like a great selection of food, beer and wine with an Italian focus this restaurant will not disappoint.\
It's recommended that you make a reservation as this place is always busy... Even on a rainy Monday night there could be a line.\
Between the upstairs, main floor and patio there are tons of different styles of seating to compliment the type of night you want to have. You'll have to be specific when booking however."\
"Great place for casual dining. Has a very social and cozy setting but the service is great. Had a Dirty Martini and the waitress was sure to ask if the Martino would be him or vodka based. Believe it or not alot of bars or restaurants don't do that courtesy. Not to mention, the food was amazing. I'm not always one for Italian, but this place did not disappoint. I had the Beef Tartare, Cacio \'e8 peep, and the chorizo pizza. For dessert, I shared a tiramisu. None of the dishes disappointed.\
\
Would definitely recommend! Also, be sure to set reservations in advanced as I went on a Tuesday evening and it was packed."\
"Highly highly recommend this Italian restaurant.\
\
The food and service was excellent!!\
Josh looked after our group.\
He recommended most if not all the dishes that we tried. also tried out the featured cocktail. everything was spot on. Supper quick, excellent pairing and we all had a great time.\
Loved the rustic look of the restaurant too."\
Good Italian food, dessert was good too, I'd take out the candied oranges on the sides to make it better. Lots of wine selection\
Wonderful place with a large patio upstairs and downstairs. Their brunch menu ranges from pizza too eggs to pancakes and an extensive drink menu. Great service as well and a fun place to chat and catch up with friends.\
"Great place for Italian food! Not sure if the owners are the same as the trattoria nervosa in Yorkville but the menu is almost identical. This place has a active vibe to it where as trattoria is more chilled and mature.\
\
Purely personal that I prefer trattoria since you don\'92t have to shout at the top of your lungs to keep a conversation going like you have to in the busy and lively gusto. Great menu nonetheless."\
"Totally amazing place. Awesome food and drinks. Must try the Mafalde ai funghi pasta. OMG!! Also the Octopus is DIVINE. A Must Try!!!\
Place is also a hang out for Shawn Mendes. Picture below of him and Camila Cabello."\
"The food was quite good. Josh did a great job. He explained the menu to us as we had a bunch of food restrictions.\
Very cozy restaurant :)"\
Great place for Italian food. Vintage Atmosphere bit not great for a private or quiet conversation. House wine is worth the price. Recommend the mushroom pasta and the pizza.\
"Food and service are amazing!\
Their own wines were little bit disappointing. I am a wine lover, so I had little bit high expextation of their own wine. But it didn't satisfy me. Anyway, I love their food, ambience, and service, so I will try other menues next time."\
Gusto is one of my favorite spots in the city! Great service, Pinterest-worthy interior, and a well rounded menu with delicious, modern Italian options. The mushroom pasta is absolutely UNREAL. Hot tip (literally): ask your server for some of the house made chilli oil to go with their fresh focaccia. So good!!!\
The truffle mushroom pasta and the kale salad are to die for. My all time favourite restaurant. I can't stand downtown but I will travel downtown for a meal from here!\
Glad to see that they required masks worn when traveling through the restaurant. Our server was amazing and gave us very clear recommendations which were amazing! We had the diavlo pizza and the mushroom pasta. The mushroom pasta was great with some added chilli oil. Also had a raspberry margarita which was good but oddly had alot of added spice.\
"Came here with friends for Brunch, its a nice restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating in the summer.\
Only giving this place 3 stars because im generally not a fan of Brunch food. I had the Uova in Camicia which was ok. I liked the poached eggs with hollandaise sauce, the potatoes were nice and crispy and there was a side of kale."\
Delicious! This place was recommended to me from a local. We had 7 people in our group with varying dietary restrictions. Everyone was extremely satisfied with the service, food, and atmosphere. I\'92d go back in a heartbeat!\
They made me a beautiful vegan pizza and it was delicious!! Love the beautiful upstairs deck with sky light, which gives the feeling of eating outside without pesky insects and wind blowing your hair into your lip gloss. The drinks menu and no reservations policy make it the perfect last minute choice for a chic dinner. One of my go-tos, along with sister restaurant Nervosa in Yorkville.\
Gusto is a great restaurant. The food is always good and you can try different dishes without being worried.\
This is my fave go-to place with my girls! We dine here at least 2-3 times a month! Their dollar an ounce wine and their mafalde pasta are what it\'92s all about! \uc0\u55357 \u56898 \u10084 \u65039 \
My favourite restaurant in all of Toronto! I have never been disappointed going here, always tastes incredible! Can\'92t wait till my next visit.\
"When you show up for your reservation and are told you have 1 hour and 45 minutes to eat it really sets a mood for your dinner.\
\
Then it takes a 1/2 hour to get even a drink when the restaurant is totally empty \'85..\
\
Finally when you want a final glass of wine and you ask the server \'93is that ok\'94 and they say \'93let me ask the front\'94 and so you wait another 10 minutes while they figure out if you can have another glass \'85.while the restaurant is still 1/2 empty\'85\'85.and then they come back and say \'93sure, you can have another glass but you can only stay for 1/2 hour\'85..\
\
Sorry, not my kind of dinning experience.\
\
I have been coming to gusto 101 for 10 years. One of my favourite places in Toronto \'85.we won\'92t be back again."\
The mushroom bruschetta is a must try. It was so delicious! I also highly recommended the fungi pasta,the sauce was amazing\
I really liked the food here! Had the mafaldi al funghi pasta, margherita pizza and the burger, and all three dishes were amazing. The pasta was so creamy, pizza was the perfect crispy texture with amazing sauce and the burger was cooked perfectly - I like that you can order it medium instead of well done. They have two stories so it wasn\'92t a problem for us to get a table on a Friday night even though we didn\'92t have a reservation.\
Had Gusto 101 for the first time last night. Everything was excellent. Arancini & the bolognese were my two favourites, they were so so so good. Best pasta I\'92ve ever had. Cannoli was also excellent. Also had salad, pizza, and fresh burrata, all very good. I\'92ve read some reviews about poor service, but this was not the case for us. The staff waiting on us were all friendly, and attentive. I accidentally had red wine dripped onto my pants and the server came right over with club soda, I didn\'92t even have to ask, and it worked! The stain was gone. Above and beyond service. Prices are fairly high, but are justified. You are getting a high quality, fresh product, in a lovely ambiance, well worth the price. Highly recommend.\
Allergy-ist if that is even a thing.  Refused to serve the table any food because one person has a peanut allergy.  Nothing on the menu contains peanuts\'85 waitress was extremely condescending.\
Wow wow wow.  Look no further. We spent an hour trying to figure out what to eat and at last this came as a suggestion. Amazing!  We tried four dishes: pizza, salad, past and tiramisu. Every single dish was great, tasty, and light.\
The food was amazing! I enjoyed the calamari & burrata the best, the meatballs are okay they had a very strong lamby taste that I didn\'92t enjoy but my partner said they were amazing.\
"Ive been to Gusto a few times. My experience was always decent. I went yesterday: service was good but food was ... Really disappointing. I ordered the bottarga (fish roe) pasta. You can count the fish roe they barely put any in, and the olive and peppers are diced so small they are nonexistent. The flavour was also non existent- just salt and olive oil.\
\
My friends had the fungi pasta - they noted half of the pasta was undercooked and hard. The pieces that were cooked, they enjoyed lol.\
\
Also ordered the truffle frites, very small portion so order your own if you were planning on sharing.\
\
Also acoustics are poor so it's extremely loud inside, you can't chat with friends unless you have a loud voice and good hearing.\
\
Cool vibe but overall experience was not the best."\
Food was delicious. Black garlic Brussel sprouts were fantastic. Lasagna was tasty and a little spicy.\
The interior is very cozy, dark, and rustic; we sat on the main floor. Our waiter was attentive and topped up our waters throughout our meal. We split the KALE SALAD ( soooo good!!) organic kale, currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino, parmigiano, with a lemon vinaigrette. We also split the PIZZA FUNGHI (yummy!!) : shiitake, oyster mushroom, fior di latte, taleggio, pecorino, and caramelized onions. A great gem on Portland!\
The service here is on point. The restaurant was starting to get crowded but we had staff coming to check in on us in a timely manner. I was pretty impressed considering how many people there were and there was also a large group there for an birthday or something, so you know they're doing well. I got this mushroom pasta which was so delicious and creamy. My friends took a little longer to show up and they were understanding of that and didn't try to rush us out or anything. They have a nice little patio too. Highly recommend to anyone.\
"First off, the service was a 5/5, server was super nice about everything.\
\
I mean the restaurant is kinda nice, but it\'92s quite loud and the restaurant is half open so it gets hot in the summer.\
\
I really liked their iconic dish the funghi pasta, but everything else we got was not good. The rest of the food was very disappointing though. I wouldn\'92t advise getting those.\
\
The polpette was super salty, the sauce was salty, and the bread was kinda too hard.\
\
The calamari was those small little rings and it\'92s not very crunchy.\
\
The bolognese was quite dry with not a lot of that beefy flavour you can get in bolognese."\
"Was pretty packed for a Wednesday night, and had a bit of a wait for a table for two, but didn't have to wait as long as we thought. Recommend planning for that. It was a busy young professional crowd, so noise level was a little high for conversation, but ambience was warm and lively. Good cocktails to start, and definitely recommend the daily special I had: Arrosto di maiale - crispy pork belly, Romano beans, fennel, rapini puree, and castelvetrano olives.\
My friend had the Polipo (grilled octopus, chimichurri, olive tapenade, piquillo pur\'e9e, lemon potatoes, and fried capers) which was also very good.\
An overall good place to unwind after a long work day or the usual social dinner and drinks."\
One of the best overall meals I've had. Everything was very fresh and service was great. The only thing I'd change is the music was a little loud. Some more beer options would also be nice.\
"Food and service are very good.\
Little bit pricey. They have a big room but at the same time lot of tables very close to each other.\
The main room is very loud. Don't know upstairs... Not ideal to have a conversation or enjoy a moment as a couple.\
Authentic decoration."\
"Awesome!!!!! When I ate a pasta, I got a shock because really good \uc0\u55357 \u56854 Pizza? How can I say? already many people wrote reviews.\
You have to come here and enjoy your meals. And then You can make a special day.\

5-star. Always consistent, always good. We had the bistecca alla fiorentina along with the amattriciana and sides of greens. Tiramisu was great. Highly recommended.}
