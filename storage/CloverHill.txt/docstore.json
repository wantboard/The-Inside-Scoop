The staff are literally the heart of this place. Their knowledge of the menu, and just overall service is a pleasure for all their guests. Each table got individualized service that made each person feel special. The menu was absolutely perfect. The dishes were small but contained so much flavor you felt like you were having full pots and pans for the dishes. Honestly the biggest highlight was the Playlist and the ambiance of the restaurant. The subtle hip hop and r&b playing definitely amplified the experience. Tracks were tasteful and definitely made me feel at home. Big j Cole fan. I am making this a repeat place to visit again. Great job to the chef and staff for making this a fine NYC restaurant.\nThis restaurant has an absolutely ridiculous cancellation policy. My boyfriend and I were visiting NYC from London and had booked Clover Hill weeks in advance because we wanted to see what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, another NYC eatery which shall remain nameless gave me food poisoning the day before. On the day of our booking (and most of the next day) I couldn\u2019t leave the hotel room or stomach anything other than water. Because of the complete lack of leniency in their policy, my boyfriend went from Midtown to Brooklyn to dine alone as he was told he wouldn\u2019t get any of his deposit back if neither of us showed. Despite this, he didn\u2019t receive his deposit back for over a week so he called them today and he\u2019s since been told that they\u2019ve withholding $75 because I did not show up. This is horrible service, the kind of snooty policy you\u2019d expect in some up tight French restaurant, a complete lack of empathy. My boyfriend spent a fortune at the restaurant yet they still want a further $75. Apparently the food wasn\u2019t up to the seafood standards you\u2019d expect for that price either. So beware if you are a tourist and book this place.\nWe had the most warm welcome the staff was so friendly with excellent recommendations. The entire restaurant felt as we were all friends.  It was the perfect vibes for my husband\u2019s birthday celebration. The food was outstanding\nProbably the best meal of my life\n\"(Translated by Google) When I went this time, they also had a holiday limited brunch\nUnfortunately, I just checked the information and found\nNow only fine dining is available for dinner\ud83e\udd72\nwhat a pity\nBecause the whole table and my friends love it so much\nBoth loaves performed very, very well\nA little distance from the station\nBut it feels like it's in a white area with a good environment\nThe streets can really be described as green\nWoohoo I originally wanted to say that I will go again when I go to New York in June\n\n\nAn amazing dining experience.

Each course was well curated overall. From the starter bite to the dessert trifecta. I would recommend it for the food hands down.

We knew we wouldn\u2019t like the rhubarb pie. It\u2019s rhubarb pie! Well, that disappeared like it was the introduction of pie as we know it. Where was the rhubarb. It was amazing regardless of the ingredients. The delicately thin crest was a marvel all on its own. Talk about a masterpiece\u2026 in your mouth that is lol.\n\nLet\u2019s not fail to acknowledge the mixologist of mixologist at the bar. Magic is the only libation being poured at the bar when it comes to the cocktail menu. My Preservation was an iconic recipe for greatness. Between the mezcal, cognac, and camomile, it could do no wrong. You forget how strong it is and fall in to the arms of the cohesiveness of the ingredients and how well they balance each other ever so slightly. Magic I tell you. With all of these wonderful pleasures for the palate, there was an unforeseen element of surprise.\n\nThe front of the house approached us to let us know our 18-19 minutes in delay of seating is cause for accepting an abbreviated menu or the need to retire at the bar. The chairs were high stools with woven seats. Not comfortable for such a dining experience. Under these circumstances, we chose the bar option out of those presented to experience all the menu had to offer. Well\u2026 by the time we concluded our courses, our seats were still unoccupied. This gave cause for us to believe, we could have kept our table and been comfortably seated at the original setting. The front of the house proceeded to note the protocol for delayed guests and timing for turning over service in a timely manner. This was after the conclusion of our service and once we asked for an explanation as to why we were seated at the bar in order to receive the full tasting. After speaking to the Chef himself, we learned that the next seating included a party of similar size that was even more delayed and protocol was clearly not followed as that party was happily seated at their table upon observation.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to those appreciative of the culinary style and fervor presented by the Chef. The playlist is wonderfully done, and the ambiance is intimate and inviting. In my opinion the front office could improve to deliver a better guest experience. Communication goes a long way. With all of that, I hope that many if not all can dine and patron Clover Hill in Brooklyn.\"\nProbably the best meal I\u2019ve ever had. Would also recommend the wine pairing.

The food was good, but there are definitely better restaurants in NYC with a Michelin star that cost considerably less than the $225 a head in Clover Hill.\n\nThe food seemed overly salted, and to offer an all-seafood tasting menu with an upsell of an extra $75 to get get a meat course (duck) feels like you are being treated as a cash-cow to be milked rather than a guest to be entertained.\n\nThe sommelier only seemed interested in selling us the wine pairing ($175 ea.) and when asked what individual bottle might go well with the meal said it was up to my taste but I should order champagne to start and walked away. When the wine did come it was not the right bottle, and they charged our bottled water (they make clear at the start of the meal that if you want water it has to be bottled water imported from England) as a mocktail, at twice the price.\n\nAny restaurant that won't serve you tap water is never going to endear itself to me, but at the end of the meal, after having racked up a check of over $1000, I asked for a glass of tap-water to wash down my coffee, and was told no I couldn't have one.\n\nWhatever about the food, that is going to be the abiding memory that I paid $1000 for the privilege of having.\"\n\"We went for a celebratory dinner to Clover Hill. The restaurant is very small and our table was in the window and uncomfortable. The staff is very attentive but pretentious in their over gushing descriptions of each course. The food was uneven in that some of the courses were delicious and others were underwhelming. It was a 50 percent hit rate.\nA 300 dollar deposit was required to make the reservation and instead of it being deducted from the bill we were told our credit card company would notify us of the refund in a few days. The cost of the meal was 1500 dollars with tip with two glasses of wine and two drinks was outrageously expensive.\nThis was our first and last visit to Clover Hill.\"\nI mean no disrespect to the chef, staff, and their time and value. However the courses served to us tonight were overly salted and a disappointment given the price point. I don\u2019t doubt that the value and sourcing of the food is deserving of a certain worth but for what we ate, we left confused and bummed. Service was good and accommodating though I wished there was more orientation to number of courses. Also drinks were pricey with limited variety.\nAmazing spot! Food was a 10/10, as was the wine pairing. I cannot wait to come back. As for the space - it was intimate, dim but well-lit, the best music but not too loud, clean dining room and clean restrooms, smelled good, very high-end and yet also inviting and comfortable.

I was only 2 minutes early so at least let me wait at the bar but he kicked me out and let these other women inside later who did come at or after opening time but I was still outside in the cold.  I don\u2019t want to remove any stars out of respect for the chef.\nOne of the best dining experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Incredible food, fantastic service, and beautiful atmosphere.

Il y a un r\u00e9el travail sur les saveurs et l\u2019esth\u00e9tisme. Nous avons go\u00fbt\u00e9 plusieurs plats et ce fut un strike total. Tr\u00e8s belle adresse!\"\n\"Although the food was good, it definitely was not worth the Michelin star!  The one thing that I thoroughly enjoyed and was impressed with was the pre-dessert (aka palette cleanser).  Seriously?!  That's it.  Don't get me wrong, the other items were tasty, but nothing to write home about.\n\nOne, they don't de-vein the shrimp!  What Michelin star restaurant doesn't do that?!  That's just pure laziness.  Two, I told them I was thirsty, but water was empty for 3 courses!  Let me remind you, I was at a table of 4 so there were 2 people serving the food, so 6 people came to the table and not one of them filled my water.  Lastly, they didn't take away the drink menus until course 4!  Really nice having menus on the table through half the meal.  I even picked it up one time in front of the servers as they were placing our food and nothing.\n\nUnfortunately, this was the worst tasting food at a Michelin star restaurant that I've ever had.  I highly recommend saving your money and don't waste the trip. Go get a pizza...That's tasty too\"\n\"Christmas eve \u201822:\nThe food is a 11 out of 10, incredible!

Food was delicious and service top notch.  They were also very accommodating to our dietary needs (pescatarian diet and nut allergies). Could not recommend more!\nIncredible\n\"I got to recently experience the Fall menu, and it was truly a memorable meal!\nThe opening honeynut squash & truffle tart immediately blew me away. There was a medley of flavors behind each course that honestly tasted super thoughtful\u2026and straight up delicious. That porcelet loin & king crab though\u2026just\u2026wow\u2026speechless.\nThe space has a nice, cozy and intimate vibe. Def perfect for a date night or dinner with some friends.\nCan\u2019t wait to come back for the winter menu!!\"\n\"Fairly disappointed with this restaurant. Felt overcharged for the portion sizes. Duck was too sweet and too rare (and I like rare). Music was weird too \u2013 not sure what they were going for.\nWould not return.\"\nOutrageously overpriced! We sat at the bar on Friday night and ordered a la carte, garlic roll ($12 for a bread roll), wagyu beef ($64 for two tiny slices of beef) and a non-alcoholic cocktail ($19). After we got the beef we asked for the check. Anyways, if this sounds normal to you then enjoy yourself!\nI was super excited to try this place out. The service was excellent but the savory courses were all too salty.\nRich flavors. Love it\nDelicious meal. Excellent servers. Small yet attractive space. I enjoyed the wine pairings. The starters were all superb. Absolutely loved the squash and hiramasa as well as the uni dish.\nAmazing!! Def the best food I have tasted in NY hands down!\nIt's a gorgeous restaurant. Just classy. But a treat. Very expensive, but worth every penny. Going to try brunch next.\nOne of the greatest meals of my life. Each plate on the tasting menu was original and creative. They had combinations of flavors and textures I would never have imagined. A wonderful experience!\nAmazing food! An experience that delights the pallet\nThis place is amazing. Food, service, atmosphere. I\u2019m so happy they finally have a Michelin star but sad now that it\u2019ll be so much harder to get a reservation!!!\nExceptional food and service. Can grow on wine pairings.\nSuperb dining experience, excellent customer service amidst great music. All the courses were delicate, flavorful (the lobster mushroom course and the snapper were my favorites :) and had my taste buds dancing. The ambiance was great with one exception - it's a small space and the table next to us was having a high volume discussion - at certain points we couldn't hear each other talk.

A worthy splurge restaurant!\n\"I came here the day after they were announced a Michelin star for brunch at 2 PM with pretty high expectations, given that several other restaurants with 1 star are solid.\n\nAfter we were seated, we waited at least 10 minutes before I finally flagged down a waitress (who was really sweet, for the record) to ask for a menu. We were informed that they were out of garlic rolls, which would have been fine if the two dishes for pre-fix brunch were not the size of an appetizer.\n\nTo give some visual of just how small, the squash veloute serving dish had to be tilted onto its side in order for the giant spoon to be useful. Speaking of giant spoons, I asked for a cappuccino (which was great) with sugar, and was given the same giant soup spoon for the sugar.  The cappuccino also took 30 minutes to arrive.\n\nOver the span of 1 hr and 15 minutes, we had 2 tiny plates (a cooled- down squash veloute and lukewarm ricotta dumplings, which consisted of 4 pieces of dumplings, each the size of my thumb). \"\"Dessert\"\" was 2 madelines, which came 10 minutes after we asked for the check.\n\nAll in all, 3 measly courses + 1 cappuccino over 1 hour 15 min = $90 with tax and tip. I'm more than happy to pay any amount for any food if it lives up to its reputation... I'm afraid neither the service nor the food did, and it certainly wasn't worth traveling to the heights.\n\nSave your hard earned money and time and bring it elsewhere.\"\nLucky to have been able to visit just days before they received their first Michelin star. My husband described it as a speakeasy-ish vibe; considering how nestled in a quiet street in Brooklyn heights it was. Understated and charming. Food and drinks were great. Congratulations Chef Mitchell!\n\"Great restaurants tell a story. This story begins in someone's great grandmother's house, in Brooklyn. As we entered the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed and immediately felt like we were in Nana Alice\u2019s dining room. So cute! The staff was definitely too-cool-for-school but you can tell they were on their best behavior. The eagle eye of a manager (who might be Nani Alice) was gleaming over the staff, ready to strike at any mistake they made. **eagle sound effect**\n\nThe prefixe brunch menu is a perfect Saturday morning hangover cure. Raw fluke in a citrus sauce first thing in the morning was exactly what I needed to regurgitate the alcohol from last nights rager. The dining room may be something from the past but the brunch menu is re-imagined for the future.\n\nIn the future, brunch does not consist of hashbrowns, pancakes, biscuits, sausage or even bacon.

Good food and service. What more can you ask for ?\nProbably one of the best meals we have ever experienced.  Had the 8 course tasting menu and everything was extraordinary!  Great service, ambience and food.\nMy dining companion and I have been twice for dinner and had two different prix-fixe menus.  Both meals were exceptional, with every course very pleasing and several freakin' AMAZING.  Staff is wonderful and the ambience perfect.\nBest omelette & sourdough I've ever had!\nEpic meal and soothing atmosphere\nDelicious food, cozy ambiance, excellent service. They offer a tasting menu and a la carte options. Portions aren\u2019t overwhelming & food presentation is top notch. One of the better overall dining experiences you can get in NYC!\n\"Came here for brunch on a summer Sunday. Great menu and beautiful spot, being run by 11MP alumni, every dish was excellent and well thought out.\n\nWe had the the following.\n\nCrudo and Charred Broccoli for our appetizer. The Crudo was crisp and refreshing while the charred broccoli had an amazing fresh umami taste.\n\nRicotta Dumplings and the Crab & Eggs were the main courses and each were beyond different but just as exciting. The dumplings were rich and earthy with a great finish while the crab and egg delivered a sort of homey feel with a flare of seafood to remind you you\u2019re still out eating Brunch and this is low key fancy.\n\nFinished it off with a nice melon sorbet which was delightfully fresh and the Madeleines which came with a side of cr\u00e8me custard that paired excellent with the hot toasty pastry.\n\nAlso ordered the peach brioche on the side and wish I had ordered two. Delicious bouncy bread with a nice custard in the middle.\"\n\"This place is just WOW.

I would recommend this place if your in the area, stop by, you won\u2019t regret it.\"\nDainty! The food was visually appealing and equally luscious. Every bite was divine! It\u2019s a tad pricey but well worth it\u2026 I will definitely stop by again on my next visit.\n\"Would give 3.5 stars if possible.\n\nThe good was that the food was amazing. However, we chose the a la cart menu instead of the tasting menu as we were looking for larger portions. Unfortunately the portions were on the smaller side so expect to have to order 3-5 dishes in total  for 2 people depending on how hungry you are.\n\nThe real downside to the experience however was the service. It wasn\u2019t a particularly busy night and each server may have had 3-4 tables however we waited quite a while for a server to come over to us at any point in the meal and even when I tried to politely signal to a waiter they would see us and avoid eye contact.\"\nThis dinner had no wrong answers, but the ceviche was probably my favorite.\nFood was incredible, we had many more dishes but after these i was just eating and not photographing. The tagliatelle was a stand out to me, with Australian truffle, it was truly amazing. The bar tender made a peach and mezcal cocktail at our request that i think should be added to the menu. Very cute interiors, perfect spot for a date. I would recommend and return to clover hill. Cheers\nHad a wonderful 5 course meal, one of my favorite meals ever. We were originally supposed to be at the bar but because it was our anniversary they gave us a table with a personalized note. The service was amazing and everyone was so kind. The food was so unique. We left with a loss of words to express what we ate. Each bite was so creative and just delicious. The summer tasting menu was so fresh. I cannot wait to return.\nWe had an incredible experience! The staff was fun and accommodating, the restaurant was beautifully decorated and felt really intimate, and the food was incredible. Our favorite dishes were the bluefin tuna and ceviche. Pricey but absolutely worth it.
