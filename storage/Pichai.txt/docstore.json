We also had the scallop salad and the papaya salad. The scallops were spicy and flavourful. They pack quite a punch in terms of heat and flavour.

The sauce used in the duck co fit was  very similar to the red curry and I was not really a fan of it. The duck itself was soft and fall off the bone tender. I quite enjoyed the vermicelli bowl, but I thought the vermicelli used was a little too thin. It was hard to differentiate between noodle other ingredients once everything was mixed together. The braised pork was tasty and reminiscent of a dish I had growing up; the dish was salty and a little sour from the vinegar.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered one of each item. I enjoyed the mango sorbet the most since it was a nice way to cut the richness from the rest of the meal. The tiramisu was also really delicious and had a nice toasted flavour.\"\nFirst is all, the lights were very dim so we couldn\u2019t see what we were eating. Food is not only taste and smell but also colour. The place was overheated. Someone remarked that it felt as if we were in Thailand. As for the food, it was fine but too spicy even though we asked for not too spicy.\nThis is the best and my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Every time I show up here, I'm impressed with the seasonal menu. It's sometimes delicate, most times an uppercut of flavors to your face. As long as they keep it fresh, I will continue to visit this place. It's too bad I can only taste so many dishes every time.\n\"(Translated by Google) Good food, but the plates contain next to nothing for the price.

We will be back!\"\nFood was great!! Lots of flavours. The Espadon red curry was deliciousssss but the fish could of been softer which shows signs of being overcooked. The curry sauce has a very strong curry and coconut taste, amazing with rice. The sparkling red wine was great as well. It went well with what we ate. Only thing I didn\u2019t like was that my waitress , as she opened my sparkling red wine , it blew everywhere. Also , when she poured my glass, it was all over the place. It wasn\u2019t a \u201cexpensive\u201d bottle but still it was 70$, it\u2019s not pleasant to see your bottle being poured like this.
