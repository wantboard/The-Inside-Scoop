We happened upon a door with NO sign on it and went in to find the most gorgeously designed restaurant. The servers were very friendly, had us hang around until a table was ready for us. We literally just had a bottle of wine and dessert. The maple tart is a must try! The service was incredible. It wasnt the wine that made everything feel so rosey. Everything about this place was wonderful.\n\\\nAmazing food and service! The interior of prime seafood is so well done and professionally thought out. If its your first time definitely chat with your server about what they would recommend and just trust what they say. <br>It is a little pricey, but everything is very fresh and the fish and meats are high end cuts. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion!\n\\\nVisited PSP yesterday evening for my fourth-year anniversary with my partner. Our waitress Sarah made our experience incredible. We ordered the filet mignon and the Sicilian crudo, along with palace potatoes. Everything was exceptional. By far the best-tasting meal we&#39;ve ever had. The quality/flavors were to die for. We also enjoyed the bread service with fresh butter, warm bread, and mussels- this was our favorite dish and we cannot stop talking about it. Our dessert (cannot remember the name) was a vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate mousse and filled with a raspberry sauce/filling. It was brought to us with a lit candle for us to blow out, it truly made our night special. The ambiance is amazing, the food was delicious, and we had the greatest experience thanks to our waitress Sarah.<br> Will definitely be visiting again for special occasions. Thank you so much for a special night!\n\\\nThis place was amazing. I felt like I was in nyc! I wish I could remember our servers name. He was amazing and knew the menu very well. Perfect dinner for friends. We ordered a bunch of everything and shared. GET THE CHOCOLATE CAKE!\n\\\nThis was a special visit (birthday) to a special restaurant. From the very beginning at the time you walk in, someone is making you very comfortable at being a guest. If you want/expect a pretentious experience, this is not the place for you. <br><br>Our servers were there for us. We had two primary servers. The male server (whose name I forgot, sorry) and Sarah.

We enjoyed the crunch from the toast and amounts of toro and uni. <br><br>2. Steak Tartare <br>Recommend by our server, this dish was just ok. We couldn&#39;t recall anything rememberable about this dish, if it was good or not. \\'a0<br><br>3. Bread Service <br>A fluffy and soft bun, this was paired with mussels, butter and mustard pickles. It was a good starter dish, and easy to share. <br><br>4. Caviar <br>This was definitely one of the highlights of the night, served with creme fraiche, chives, shallots and chips. The chips were thin and light, easy to eat with the caviar. <br><br>5. Lobster &amp; Spaghetti <br>Exactly what you would expect. Tasty dish, and good amounts of lobster. <br><br>6. Prime Rib Roast <br>This was definitely our favourite dish of the night, super tender and juicy. We definitely enjoyed the centre middle pieces more than the ends. \\'a0<br><br>7. Bone-in Striploin <br>Nothing can go wrong with a classic striploin steak, although the prime rib was better. <br><br>8. Fluke <br>A fish dish that was just ok. The plate had a butter sauce, trout roe and some herbs. <br><br>We also ordered some of the veggies, sides and sauces to pair with our dishes. <br>- palace potatoes <br>- Yorkshire pudding <br>- Baby gem salad <br>- Carrot tart <br>These were carb heavy, and we only tried a little of each. The palace potatoes were one of the more memorable sides as it was a cute square shape with multiple thin layers of potato. <br><br>Overall, this is a solid spot for a nice dinner out. We enjoyed the ambiance and our time spent here.\n\\\nThe scent of the grill is hypnotizing.

The steak was also cooked perfectly \\'a0loved everything\n\\\nWe made reservations at the bar a few weeks before to celebrate a birthday and were excited. The restaurant is located in an inconspicuous building on Queen St. W. When you walk in, the wood-filled interior is stunning, and so are the two washrooms, where you notice small details which elevate the aesthetic appeal of the restaurant. Going in, we did have high expectations as it was Matty Matheson&#39;s restaurant. <br><br>For two people, we decided to splurge and ordered the sea urchin on toast ($90), crudo (small, $45), lobster and spaghetti ($45), prime rib roast sliced ($90), and palace potatoes ($21). <br><br>We enjoyed the crudo and the lobster spaghetti. The crudo was fresh, and the lobster spaghetti was creamy and buttery. <br><br>The biggest disappointment was the sea urchin on a toasted bun. Sea urchin is expensive as it is, and because of the toast, you could barely taste the sea urchin. There were too many textures and flavours packed into 2-4 bites. <br><br>We got the prime rib roast with the house gravy. The prime rib took an hour to arrive, and our server gifted us a bottle of water to compensate. The sauce was good, but the prime rib was chewy, and we couldn&#39;t finish it. <br><br>The service was terrific, but we were disappointed by the food.\n\\\nService and ambience was amazing. Lobster spaghetti was my favourite dish. I also really enjoyed the ceviche, mashed potatoes, and chocolate cake.\n\\\nI&#39;ve been waiting a long time to try this place and never had the chance until recently. Although reservations are easier to come by, I would still recommend booking a few weeks in advance. I believe reservations open 30 days in advance. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely on the pricier end of Matty Matheson&#39;s but quite honestly I think it was worth the price. <br><br>The prime rib was extremely good and I want to come back to try their steak. There wasn&#39;t a dish I didn&#39;t like. Highly recommend the squid, potatoes, and lobster pasta. <br><br>It&#39;s a beautiful restaurant, making it a great place to bring a date, clients, or just people you want to impress for a meal.\n\\\nTLDR; go for the interior design, stay for everything else. <br>To be completely honest, we were not expecting much out of this experience. We went in thinking that it would be all about the interior design and weren&#39;t particularly excited about the way the menu read and were planning on a few drinks and apps. \\'a0<br>From the second we walked in the door we were proven wrong.

Bacon is made chashu style and was so snackable and tender with the perfect amount of fat and the bread was so delicious with tender mussels. <br>Got the prime rib and mashed potatos for mains and they were both delicious and a great pair (per Emma&#39;s recommendation also). <br>Large portions across the board and left beyond stuffed and satisfied. Amazing job to the team and staff!\n\\\nThe Emperor&#39;s New Clothes. Extremely expensive (~$400 per person) with nothing to show for it. Food was not tasty nor delicious. Bread &#34;service&#34; meant one serving of burnt bread (with excellent mussels, I&#39;ll give them that compliment). Uni sandwich tasted like toast only, which covered the taste and texture of the tuna belly and sea urchin. Steak ($165) was unforgivably overcooked and bland. Service took so long that we were not allowed to order dessert. To be clear, we were basically ignored all night and then forced to leave the restaurant unsatisfied. I will not return. My reservation said we were supposed to be seated in the cottage room, but, instead, they put us at the worst table in the main room.\n\\\nThick pieces of blue fin tuna, kampachi, and king salmon are showcased in the Sicilian crudo ($45 for a small), cut to a sashimi-like thickness. There is no shortage of olive oil used in the crudo, the fish swimming in a plate of it. Yet, despite all the herbs, dish lacked flavour; if only they reduced the oil and added a sprinkle of salt instead.<br><br>Cheese and seafood aren&#39;t a popular combination. Despite that, the delicate thinly sliced grilled Humboldt squid ($34) went remarkably well with creamy Stracciatella cheese. Maitake mushrooms, being a lighter fungus, didn&#39;t detract from the squid and dairy&#39;s natural flavours, the combination so tasty heaped onto a piece of well-toasted sourdough. Of all the starters, this was my favourite.<br><br>The Palace bacon ($18 for 3 pieces, extra $6 to add the fourth) was also delightful, a char sui flavoured pork belly that&#39;s sticky and sweet. The fat was well-rendered, so the pork belly simply melted in my mouth. Delicious on its own (not overly salty), it could be equally tasty sandwiched in in a soft bao bun.<br><br>In hindsight, I should have put a piece of bacon into the molasses bread. For $21, the bread service was rather disappointing. Sure, the molasses bread was fragrant and unique - it was like having gingerbread in a bun form - but the accompaniments were lacklustre... the butter needed salt, the mustard pickles run-of-the-mill, and the kippered mussels weren&#39;t the freshest tasting.

If it weren&#39;t for our waitress&#39; long story about how this was Matheson&#39;s grandmother&#39;s recipe and filled with East Coast charm, we would have skipped the bread service all together.<br><br>Perhaps I should have relied on my own instincts as I found her recommendations to be a let down. While the cote de boeuf ($275) was a beautiful cut of beef and cooked well, it was just so bland. Strangely, some Google reviews claim dishes are too salty, I wonder if the kitchen is overcompensating and has simply started under seasoning everything.<br><br>At least our waitress warned us that the cote de boeuf was neutral and suggested an order of sauce. The grilled onion chimichurri ($8) seemed like a logical choice but was too fussy - the mustard or wasabi added gave it a bitter after taste and detracted from the beef. Give me a simple chimichurri any day; or better yet, just some salt and pepper on the steak.\n\\\nH\\'e1- just read the review that is previous to mine- I also loved the bread service and the prime rib. \\'a0What not to get though- uni toast- could not taste the uni or the tuna... only toast! For 90 something dollars for 2 servings.... It was very sad. I tried the uni by itself and... very fresh! But the dish does not highlight the main events. Lobster pasta also just okay- despite what was said on Google reviews- my fault for reading Google reviews. <br><br>Drinks menu was just okay- nothing shaken, only stirred, so we were told. <br><br>We sat at the bar so service was a bit... choppy? Lacklustre? I&#39;m not sure. <br><br>We will be back for..... <br><br>Yes bread service and prime rib.\n\\\nHave you watched &#34;The Bear&#34;? A show about the restaurant business.

They ensured we got some drinks as we waited, which was nice. I was just surprised that we waited so long with reso in hand. We walked through the kitchen (to get to cottage room seating)\\'85and it was pristine - absolutely impressed with that. Our server, Emma, was wonderful and every other staff member was too - table clean up, placing plates etc. Sommeliers were great too!  For the food, the only major disappointment was that we ordered to 30oz ribeye medium-rare and it truly was too charred and well done. I am not sure how kitchen let that out. On the plus side, they brought us another piece of meat (prime-rib, which is a cheaper cut) but cooked to our liking. Again, great service, but come on\\'85how are you going to send out a well done steak when we asked for med-rare! Other dishes were alright, I wasn\\'92t mind-blown\\'85but it was good. The prime rib was tasty for sure. The cocktails were delicious! Ambiance is beautiful.\n\\\nGorgeous room, genuinely content staff;  Efficient service.  Apps: amazing trout/waffles, super-fresh Sicilian crudo. Steak was good, but left me wanting to exchange it for more appetizers!  Next time... Decent wines BTG, and delicious Kagua beer.  Thank you!\n\\\n\"Very disappointing experience, food was below average but service was good.\\\n- SEA URCHIN, TORO, TOAST: couldn't taste any sweetness from urchin or any richness from toro\\\n- MACKEREL: flavor combination was ok but again the fish has zero taste. Mackerel is supposed to taste richer when you chew it more, but this didn't have the desired texture or taste\\\n- BREAD SERVICE: brown sugar butter bread, the mussels, pickles, butter were nice by themselves but it didn't add anything when combine with bread. The taste was separated, bread is bread and side is side\\\n- PRIME RIB ROAST: flavorful and fatty, favorite of the night\\\n- DAUPHINE POTATO & SHORT RIB PIE: recommended by Canada Best 100 guide, it was good but nothing special\\\n- KEY LIME PIE: cream was too heavy to me personally\"\n\\\nBeautiful space, amazing non-pretentious service, delicious food. Went here with a friend for a birthday/Mother\\'92s Day dinner. Our server was so friendly and funny and gave us great recommendations. We ordered the crudo, gem salad, Yorkshire pudding, lobster and spaghetti, prime rib 12 oz, palace potatoes, key lime pie, and chocolate cake. The crudo dressing was delicious I kept eating it alone after the fish was done and the slices are fish were thick and bountiful.

Both desserts were flavourful and had perfect texture and balance. The mocktails were also delicious! They even moved us to a larger table without us asking because we had ordered so much food and they thought we could be more comfortable with a bit more space. Yes it is expensive, but food and operating costs are high these days. The level of attention and care the food and service was given warrants the price.

The best restaurant experience of the year.\n\\\nI went for my girlfriends 30th and probably had the best experience I could have! Food was very good but the staff were absolutely exceptional. Would recommended to anyone!\n\\\nOur meal was a reunion with dear friends while we were visiting from NS - An extraordinary dining experience. Upon entrance the architecture was spectacular, a modern day piece of art, like nothing I had ever seen. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was refreshingly fun and relaxing, with great music playing throughout the evening. Each course was eloquently prepared to perfection.  We sampled almost the entire menu, thanks to Maddy, and were blown away by each and every dish. Highlights included bone-in striploin, palace bacon, and lamb lasagna, and we especially loved the steak tartare, lobster spaghetti, and to die for key lime pie. Quite simply, this place is a unique collaboration of style, sophistication, and culinary genius. Best meal my husband and I ever had! We can\\'92t wait to return during our next visit to Toronto and both highly recommend PSP.\n\\\nDishes of multiple influences prepared and presented with dexterity and class. The crudo, coppa, palace bacon and halibut with the fish eggs (I would cook it 30 seconds less) were great. We also tried the molasse, palace potatoes and filet mignon. The rich cow brie cheese tart with maple syrup was decadent! Not your typical restaurant, not your typical price but worth trying.\n\\\nThis restaurant gave me one of the best meals I have ever had. As soon as you walk into the establishment the ambiance is like no other. Upon sitting down and looking over the menu you are treated to some of the most exceptional and knowledgeable service. The crab cocktail was absolutely phenomenal and the palace bacon was some of the best pork I have ever consumed. Moving on to the main courses the peppercorn filet and 20 oz prime rib were extremely tender and juicy. All of the sides are amazing.

And bread service like this is supposed to be served free prior to the meal in my opinion.

Eager to return to try more dishes! Leave room for that key lime pie. Holy Hell is delicious.\n\\\nI debated this review, would have liked to give this restaurant a four star, but just couldn't. The positive is the atmosphere in the  main dining room; just beautiful. The negatives: the location, lots of staff but slow service, wine list lacks depth, food masked with too much sauces. Finally, get a minimum dress code for your patrons. Start with no toques allowed while dining.\n\\\n\"I visited Prime Seafood Palace with my wife on a Tuesday night and overall, it was a pleasant experience.

And be sure to visit the indescribable bathroom! #seashell #skylight\n\\\nThe interior is beautiful and the service was great.  However, the food wasn\\'92t what I was hoping for.  The lobster and spaghetti dish is TINY and the filet mignon needed extra seasoning.  We found that the Sicilian crudo was the most disappointing for us.  Oh well.. it was a fun night out.\n\\\nWe dined in the cottage area and enjoyed all of our dishes ordered. The crab may have been my all-time favourite! Our daughter came with us and we found picks for her that she also enjoyed.\n\\\n\"Last night we were treated to an amazing four hour, five course meal at Prime Seafood (cold seafood, warm seafood, appetizers, mains, dessert) enjoyed family style amongst the five of us. The dishes were all delicious, unique and memorable. We were happy to take in a few bottles of wine and pay the $75 corkage fee. The somm, Jing, was very attentive and helpful.\\\n\\\nThe total bill came to $350 per person all-in so it\\'92s definitely expensive but you get what you pay for.

Expected more .\\\n\\\nWon\\'92t return\"\n\\\n\"I see a lot of really positive reviews but from the moment we stepped inside to the moment we left, our experience was pretty horrible for a restaurant of this calibre.\\\n\\\nThe good: decor is really pretty. Potatoes were delicious. The chocolate cake is very decadent.\\\n\\\nThe bad: our server was incredibly rude. Condescending actually. Not helpful with drinks, and once he took our order we never saw him again. One of the sides was sold out and when we asked for a minute to think about what we\\'92d get instead, he rolled his eyes and did not leave the table.\\\n\\\nThe server recommended we do NOT order the prime rib - super weird considering that\\'92s what they\\'92re known for. Instead suggested the $200 steak. Okay cool, he must know what he\\'92s talking about.\\\n\\\nThe steak came out grey with the littlest amounts of pink, with the plate full of juice.\\\n\\\nWe each took a bite and realized that it was not medium rare, and quite over cooked.\\\n\\\nThe staff who served us (again not our server) told us we were incorrect and that the steak was indeed medium rare.\\\n\\\nHe brought his manager over who reiterated because it\\'92s an aged steak it wouldn\\'92t be pink and the grey did not indicate it was over cooked.\\\n\\\nFrom the service to the food, even the cocktails - I\\'92ll never go back and I\\'92ll never recommend anyone go. Way better places in the city for steak where the staff doesn\\'92t treat you like a burden for coming in.\\\n\\\nSuper disappointing because I really do love chef mattys other spots.\"\n\\\nFerking amazing on all fronts.

All of the restaurants I've been to owned by Matty have been delicious. Worth a try.\n\\\nExcellent experience all around for my friend Riley and I. The food was executed so well and amazing quality. All of the people working were so friendly and accommodating. Zac and Dylan were outstanding and really helped make the night.\n\\\nThe service was really good, our waitress was polite and attentive. The host was accommodating for a different seating arrangement. However, I think this place is overhyped being apart of the Matty Matheson chain. My gf and I love Fonda balsam so we assumed we would love this place as well but this place falls short. Expect to pay 200$ pp; the taste and quality is good but definitely not at that price point.\n\\\nI was admittedly sceptical going in because of the price, but it was worth it.

Also the portion sizes are like what you would see on the Flintstones, massive, think about sharing everything. It could have been split between 3-4 people. I had the prime rib and it was amazing.  They also blast classic rock music the entire time. Would only recommend this place to friends or family with deep pockets\n\\\nThe server kind of killed the experience for us.

The tar tar, toro toast and key lime pie were the highlights. The palace potatoes live up to the hype. Although it was a pricey dinner it was well worth it. Highly recommend!\n\\\n\"We made reservations at the bar a few weeks before to celebrate a birthday and were excited. The restaurant is located in an inconspicuous building on Queen St. W. When you walk in, the wood-filled interior is stunning, and so are the two washrooms, where you notice small details which elevate the aesthetic appeal of the restaurant. Going in, we did have high expectations as it was Matty Matheson's restaurant.\\\n\\\nFor two people, we decided to splurge and ordered the sea urchin on toast ($90), crudo (small, $45), lobster and spaghetti ($45), prime rib roast sliced ($90), and palace potatoes ($21).\\\n\\\nWe enjoyed the crudo and the lobster spaghetti. The crudo was fresh, and the lobster spaghetti was creamy and buttery.\\\n\\\nThe biggest disappointment was the sea urchin on a toasted bun. Sea urchin is expensive as it is, and because of the toast, you could barely taste the sea urchin. There were too many textures and flavours packed into 2-4 bites.\\\n\\\nWe got the prime rib roast with the house gravy. The prime rib took an hour to arrive, and our server gifted us a bottle of water to compensate. The sauce was good, but the prime rib was chewy, and we couldn't finish it.\\\n\\\nThe service was terrific, but we were disappointed by the food.\"\n\\\nService and ambience was amazing. Lobster spaghetti was my favourite dish. I also really enjoyed the ceviche, mashed potatoes, and chocolate cake.\n\\\nEverything tasted amazing thank you!\n\\\n\"Not a peacock from the outside... You'll have to trust the address to know you're at the correct place, but like all good things that have real greatness the good stuff is on the inside.

The staff was so kind with them. They did not have highchairs and one member of the staff offered to fashion a booster out of decorative blankets. The food was expensive, but worth it. The salad was a major sleeper on the menu. Still can't figure out how a dressing could be that good. Matty walked in the door behind us, which was amazing because my 5 year old often watches him with me on TV. Service was great, atmosphere was great. We even got to check out the kitchen! We are grateful to the staff for making our night something to remember. And another thing, my partner is gluten free and the chef was so accommodating.\n\\\nAn amazing dining experience.

I was a bit disappointed that there was so much meat in their dishes as I\\'92m pescatarian and based on the name of the restaurant, I assumed most dishes would just be seafood. If you are also lactose intolerant, the options decrease even drastically as dairy is used in most of their dishes as well.\\\n\\\nMy favourite dish by far was the bread selection. The molasses bread was soo good and nothing I\\'92ve had before. The rest of our dishes were honestly pretty mediocre.\\\n\\\nIt\\'92s a very cool vibe and I\\'92m happy we got to check it out but I wouldn\\'92t come back, (keeping in mind we don\\'92t eat meat or dairy so there\\'92s just not much on the menu for us to enjoy).\"\n\\\nA must visit\n\\\nI have never been so impressed by staff and cuisine. I will definitely be coming back as soon as I can.\n\\\nAmazing meal. Exceeded expectations. Will be back next special occasion for sure.\n\\\n\"Thick pieces of blue fin tuna, kampachi, and king salmon are showcased in the Sicilian crudo ($45 for a small), cut to a sashimi-like thickness. There is no shortage of olive oil used in the crudo, the fish swimming in a plate of it. Yet, despite all the herbs, dish lacked flavour; if only they reduced the oil and added a sprinkle of salt instead.\\\n\\\nCheese and seafood aren\\'92t a popular combination. Despite that, the delicate thinly sliced grilled Humboldt squid ($34) went remarkably well with creamy Stracciatella cheese. Maitake mushrooms, being a lighter fungus, didn\\'92t detract from the squid and dairy\\'92s natural flavours, the combination so tasty heaped onto a piece of well-toasted sourdough. Of all the starters, this was my favourite.\\\n\\\nThe Palace bacon ($18 for 3 pieces, extra $6 to add the fourth) was also delightful, a char sui flavoured pork belly that\\'92s sticky and sweet. The fat was well-rendered, so the pork belly simply melted in my mouth. Delicious on its own (not overly salty), it could be equally tasty sandwiched in in a soft bao bun.\\\n\\\nIn hindsight, I should have put a piece of bacon into the molasses bread. For $21, the bread service was rather disappointing. Sure, the molasses bread was fragrant and unique - it was like having gingerbread in a bun form - but the accompaniments were lacklustre\\'85 the butter needed salt, the mustard pickles run-of-the-mill, and the kippered mussels weren\\'92t the freshest tasting. If it weren\\'92t for our waitress\\'92 long story about how this was Matheson\\'92s grandmother\\'92s recipe and filled with East Coast charm, we would have skipped the bread service all together.\\\n\\\nPerhaps I should have relied on my own instincts as I found her recommendations to be a let down.

The grilled onion chimichurri ($8) seemed like a logical choice but was too fussy - the mustard or wasabi added gave it a bitter after taste and detracted from the beef. Give me a simple chimichurri any day; or better yet, just some salt and pepper on the steak.\"\n\\\n\"Everything is expensive, and not good value for money. The dessert tarts (keylime pie and custard puff pastry) arrived naked on a small plate each, with no decorations or sauce around it.

The carrot tarts was incredibly salty but very well presented. The Crudo didn\\'92t taste like much and the steak tartare tasted more of sesame vs steak which really didn\\'92t make it worth it.\\\n\\\nThe service was underwhelming with our sever disappearing for extended periods of times.\\\n\\\nOverall the music didn\\'92t fit the space which was strange a bunch of classic rock vs what you would think you would get from the space.\\\n\\\nWould agree with others that it was over priced for what you get and would say you can get a better meal elsewhere in the city for less.\"\n\\\n\"Have you watched \\'93The Bear\\'94?

Interior is absolutely gorgeous (but don\\'92t go if you get dizzy staring at too many lines)\\\n\\\nWe had a variety of plates from the uni toast, special fish of the day, the bacon, a couple veggies dishes and a steak. Ultimately, their veggies dishes were our favourite. The steak wasn\\'92t mind blowing and the turbot lacked a wow factor. The uni toast was a texture adventure ($90 for 2). Ultimately, the seafood / steak was lacking a surprise and it was great one time visit.\"\n\\\nUnlike it\\'92s interior design. The food was not that great and definitely not worth the price. Their cocktails weren\\'92t that great and very pricey. The service was okay but it could be much better\n\\\nRestaurant is beautiful!
