The beef tartar could use a touch of mustard seeds and the prime rib was a little over cooked.  The French onion soup was good but a tad on the sweet side.  I give it 4 stars for the service here.  They were very attentive. Maybe their other dishes are good.\n\\\n\"We were excited to come and try out this new place as the decor looked great on the outside. We were a bit confused about the entrance to the resto as we entered through the patio doors. They luckily allowed us to enter from that door as we had reservations on the patio.\\\n\\\nService was both good and bad. Upon being seated, we were told that we could not be seated on a both since we were 3 people but we saw many booths filled with only 2 people throughout the evening. Some of us took advantage of the advantage of the prime rib Sunday deal which includes caesar salad, 12 oz Northern Gold Slow roasted Prime Rib, Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, and a B+B Buttercake for dessert.\\\n\\\nWe had hoped that the salad be prepped table side like the other patrons but maybe it was due to the fat that it was part of the combo.  The salad was great with light sauce as well as crispy romaine lettuce and anchovies on top. I was not a big fan of the Yorkshire pudding and the prime rib was just ok. There was confusion on the plates as one of us ordered the regular 14 oz instead of the combo. We got brussel sprouts for our seasonal greens and the mash was pretty good. The buttercake was just average but nice and warm.\\\n\\\nPatio outside was nice but somewhat on the warm side. Loved the interior decor and the bar plus the washrooms were upstairs. At times, it could be difficult to navigate to the stairs as there were only 3 paths given the table layout. The one near the impressive meat aging cabinet had lots of wait staff near the POS while the middle path was the same. The only unobstructed path was the far end by the front windows around the bar.\\\n\\\nFor a Sunday night, there were many tables filled. Overall a good experience but will wait for a while to return.\"\n\\\nBoth Food and service was wonderful\n\\\nWow. I\\'92ve never written a google review before, but I just have to for this restaurant. We came here on Monday (May 22) to celebrate an anniversary. We had a very below average experience. We ordered the brioche, mushroom risotto, 16 oz rib eye with truffle jus, king salmon roll, brussel sprouts, and butter cake, and 2 cosmopolitans. The night started off with a complimentary which I thought was a really nice touch, and it was delicious. I did notice our server only filled our glasses up half way while he filled other tables glasses up all the way. I was not too bothered by it, but found it strange. Next came our cosmopolitans. They come with some sort of smoke bubble on them. After he put the bubble on my partner\\'92s drink, he gave up on mine after multiple failed attempts; I was a bit disappointed. Next came the brioche. It was HUGE! I would recommend getting this for 4 or more people. It was good, but nothing special.

It\\'92s tasted very fresh, 10/10. We then got the risotto. It wasn\\'92t very flavorful and the rice was undercooked. We then waited VERY long for our steak to come. It was awkward to sit at a table for so long with no food while everyone around us was eating. Our server came to our table to tell us it\\'92s taking so long because we ordered it medium well and that\\'92s normal. No, that\\'92s not normal! We waited at least an hour to get our steak after finishing the risotto. When we got the steak, it wasn\\'92t even good. No flavour and uneven cooking. Some pieces were medium well, but most were well done. I had much higher expectations for a steakhouse. The truffle jus tasted nothing like truffle. I asked my server if it was the right one because it didn\\'92t taste like truffle. He said \\'93one moment I\\'92ll be right back\\'94. Here I am thinking he is going to double check with the kitchen or do something to make it better. Instead he comes back with a glass, pours it in the glass, and then proceeds to drink it! NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HAD A SERVER EAT OFF MY TABLE! That is completely unacceptable! He then says it\\'92s the right one and leave the half empty jus on the table. The brussel sprouts were completely burnt. I love crispy brussel sprouts, but I couldn\\'92t eat these. Lastly, we had the butter cake it was good, but a bit too sweet. When we got our bill I saw that we were charged for the tuna roll instead of the salmon. When I pointed it out, the server told us it\\'92s the same price; it\\'92s not\\'85..To top off this awful night, not one person acknowledged that it was our anniversary. If you\\'92re not going to acknowledge this then don\\'92t ask what the occasion is on the booking! I will definitely not be returning to this restaurant! The 2 stars are for the sushi and welcome cocktail.\n\\\nHave you had beef Wellington before? If not, get it. If yes, you\\'92ve never had one as good as the one here.

Food was great - I took a break from my usual vegetarian fare to get the full experience\n\\\nInitially walking into this place we had high expectations. We ate here on Friday the week of the opening. The food was really good (simple, delicious but missing that wow factor) we had the calamari, oysters, the ribeye and lobster mash potatoes. My boyfriend and I didn\\'92t love our cocktails. The two stars deducted was for the service. Our waitress rarely came to check in on us, our drink took nearly a half an hour to come and we had to flag down another waitress to refill our water, get us extra condiments for our oysters and check on the drinks. Maybe it was just one bad experience but definitely no where near the level of service I would expect for a high end steakhouse.\n\\\n\"The interior and heated patio were both nice decor. We opted for patio fewer people and seemed more and quiet.  Our server was nice, and there was a show and tell for cuts of meat. After all, it is a steak house.\\\nWe went  20oz canadian prime cow boy rib eye good rendering of fat cooked medium it was good done just right.

Nice patio, lots of room. Great food, pricey but not outrageous. Attentive staff. But two things bothered me and for those reasons I will not return. First,  when I arrived I was offered a table on the patio, I agreed as there were heaters. I am one of only 3 occupied tables on the patio.  Half way through the meal, I am cold. I look and the heaters are off.  I ask the staff to turn them on as I am cold. They are turned on. By this time I have been there for an hour. I am then informed that a table who arrived after me and are sitting with their coats on are hot and I would have to move as it is a conflict. Apparently they are more important. I am not impressed. As I have now invited people to join me it will be awkward for us to move, I decline. The heaters are now off. It is 12 degrees outside. Secondly one of the wines we are drinking is no longer available and a different wine is suggested. We are not informed that it is a higher priced wine until we see the bill. Not acceptable in my opinion. So this place was ok but not pleased that someone else's comfort is seen as more important than mine. Good food but next time I will go else where.\n\\\nFantastic steak\n\\\nAlways an exceptional meal at B&B, in any city fortunate to have one.

Exceptional service matches the food.\n\\\n\"Went here for my birthday dinner with my husband  and I was really excited based on the menu and influencers reviews to date.\\\n\\\nWhen we arrived the hostesses weren't very welcoming and didn't really acknowledge us until we provided our name for the reservation. Immediately we felt judged as though we weren't the type of clientele they target despite being dressed nicely and clearly aware what kind of prices we were about to pay for dinner.\\\n\\\nWe were seated in a section on the first floor where there was barely any room between tables of two. It was so loud in the restaurant that you had to shout to your partner at the other side of the table and you could hear every conversation happening at the tables next to you. This was already not the intimate dinner I was planning on having.\\\n\\\nThe waiter was nice but definitely didn't put as much attention to detail or care as much to wait on us as he did other tables that had more \"\"corporate\"\" clientele. I had also added that it was a birthday dinner in my reservation but not one person acknowledged or asked if we were celebrating anything.\\\n\\\nWe also ordered the gruyere brioche but we're told throughout our two hour seating that it was in the oven. We had finished our entire meal and never got any bread. \\uc0\\u55357 \\u56398 \\\n\\\nThe food was good but ultimately I wouldnt go back. The restaurant is jam packed to fit as many tables as possible so there are constantly waiters hitting the back of your chair and running back and forth. The whole vibe is super hectic and seemed like a place solely made for finance people and influencers. Overall I was pretty disappointed but we made the best of it and will not be returning.\"\n\\\n\"Their prix fixe lunch menu ($45) offers diners a choice of a main with either an appetizer or dessert (some supplements required). Word for the wise: you\\'92ll want to share the appetizers as some dishes are rich and the portion sizes would impress a Texan.\\\n\\\nThinly sliced barely seared beef forms a beautiful ruby base for the beef carpaccio. Dressed in horseradish crema and tangy pickled shimeji mushrooms, the two give the meat bright pops of flavour. Personally, I would have gone with either the crispy shallot or fried capers on the dish; having both seems like overkill and the oily garnishes overtook the delicate tender beef. But the slices of shaved parmesan were a great addition offering a bit of sweet and saltiness.\\\n\\\nBlack + Blue\\'92s calamari is left in thick sticks, lovely bites of tender and meaty squid.

A huge cone of sizzling hot parmesan fries arrives with the steak frites ($15 supplement), they are deliciously covered with a layer of cheese and a bit of parsley for a fresh richness. Once again, I did find them over seasoned so with the garlic aioli (a tasty rendition) it ends up being too salty. I also had to leave the red wine jus unused as it was a bit too soy sauce and beef stock heavy to pair with the steak.\\\n\\\nThe steak frites includes a sizeable sirloin but it was cooked poorly: the medium rare is well seared on the outside but still fully rare in the middle. My husband, an excellent steak preparer, hypothesizes that the meat was too cold before being placed in the pan, evidenced by the tell-tale ring instead of a gradient doneness.\\\n\\\nWhen my friend mentioned the undercooked steak to the manager, he brought over a doneness card to indicate the steak was cooked to their medium rare standard. My recommendation: print more of these cards and place one in each menu, so diners understand Black + Blue\\'92s definition as it doesn\\'92t appear to follow the Toronto standard.\\\n\\\nStill, the manager was nice about it and noted they would have been happy to put the steaks back on the grill (likely not something chefs trying to time the next table would be \\'93happy\\'94 about) and made up for the miscommunication with a plate of petit fours.\\\n\\\nUnderdone steak aside, Black + Blue nailed their service as everyone was a delight: professional and attentive without making the restaurant seem stuffy.\"\n\\\nCame here to celebrate a birthday.

The Atmosphere and decor was nice and service was good but my girlfriend wanted to take photos of the food but the server served us our portions of everything before putting the plate down. Amazing service but no photos for her to put up on her Instagram, oh well.\\\n\\\nTHE BAD: Upon walking in and letting the hostess know I had a reservation, I could already feel like I was being judged. The hostess asked if we would like to be seated on the patio and I let her know that my girlfriend has allergies and would prefer to be seated indoors. At which point she started talking with another worker and took them about 2 minutes to figure out where to put us. After that we were brought to our table upstairs after passing possibly 2-3 empty tables downstairs that could seat 2 people. Now, our table upstairs was on the outside further from the ledge and beside the only other people in that section. We asked to be moved to a different spot diagonal from where we were seated. Already, I wasn't feeling very welcome. After being seated it was painfully obvious that the upstairs had all of the ethnic people and families with small children. This was especially surprising as the hostess was a POC. I wanted so hard to believe it was a coincidence but even as the night progressed it did not improve.\\\n\\\nSuch a shame as the food was great but because of the experience at the front, I would think twice before returning.\"\n\\\n\"It was quite fitting to have Trevor as our server for Mother\\'92s Day dinner, since we\\'92ve known him from the time our daughter was in the stroller [she\\'92s 11 y.o. now]. His experience through the years is evident because his timing and awareness of the people he is serving is impeccable. He knew when to check in and was quite knowledgeable of the sure fire hits that the menu had to offer - that while also caring for the rest of his team in the restaurant. It was a sight to see!\\\n\\\nThe Crispy Calamari with italian parsley charred jalape\\'f1o aioli for starters was delicious.

The food was out of this world, but your caring and attentiveness just made it all the more special. We\\'92ll be back with our appetites sometime soon for sure.\"\n\\\n\"Came in here Saturday night for dinner with friends (May 13). I walked in with 2 girls to meet the rest of our group and was greeted by the hostesses. One of the hostesses says \\'93so I just wanna let you know that if you want to eat here next time, the dress code is business casual. Your server might mention it to you so just say that you know for next time, you guys can\\'92t be dressed like that\\'94\\\nEXCUSE ME WHAT???\\\nFirst, the girls were in dresses and second, I was wearing high waisted jeans, a classy bralette top and wedges (all designer may I add). I responded with \\'93okay, I\\'92m a business owner and this is my business attire so define business\\'94 and we \\'93laughed\\'94 it off because had I said what I really wanted to say, it wouldn\\'92t have been so nice.\\\nWe were brought to the table and honestly my whole experience was disturbed the whole evening because of that very tasteless comment. I highly doubt any of the hostesses told the gentlemen sitting at the table next to our about the dress code as they sat there in their Maple Leafs jerseys\\\n\\\nOn a positive note, our servers Allison and Elizabeth were lovely, super attentive and kind! The food was really good; our steak was cooked perfectly, the seafood tower was delicious. A big shout out to the chefs on that sashimi platter, it was phenomenal and so fresh.\\\n\\\nAt the end of service, I asked Allison if during their training, they were told to tell their guests about dress code and she said No so I was a little confused.\\\n\\\nA message to the owner: you have a great spot but your hostesses should be careful not to say stuff like to people coming in spending over $1000+ on dinner; Allison and that sashimi platter are the only reasons I may come back again\"\n\\\nWent for the first time, very excited to attend! Ordered a $499 bottle of Caymus and was very surprised when the waiter poured himself 3 oz to \\'93test\\'94 it without asking. Ordered a table side Caesar salad which was not prepared tableside however everyone around us had theirs prepared table side. Our chateaubriand was horrible! There was gristle in it, which sadly indicates poor quality of meat in a tenderloin, not to mention a true chateaubriand is accompanied with vegetables and potatoes and this one was not. 16oz of poor quality meat for $128.

Also to note their bathroom is in a communal hallway, with men and women together. Bread is also $12 and whopping $15 for 10 French fries.\n\\\nThe service here is beyond amazing! They will treat you VERY well. Amazing atmosphere and decor too. Food is also very well done. He prepared to spend money $$$ but it\\'92s worth it and portion sizes are very good.\n\\\n\"Asked for a booth when reserved on line. Got there and was told they don\\'92t do that . So why did they not email me to let me know that ?\\\nFood was mediocre to say the most .\\\nOrdered salmon of which was not worth $44 . My daughter ordered the seafood carbonara. Pasta was quite undercooked. Very crowded when walking around. Waiters are always in the way . Bathroom doors weigh a ton and were difficult to push open. Clientele @ front leave a lot to be desired. After complaining about no booth 3 different staff got involved. Finally got a booth but were told we had a time limit . Will definitely NOT go back . Totally overrated. Place was nice but staff and food definitely need to be upgraded. Went for MOTHERS day . What a mistake. Would have been better off @ the KEG.\\\nGlasses were not sparkling clean either . Only thing was OK was the complimentary cocktail. NOT IMPRESSED WHATSOEVER! Very disappointed especially after driving through the traffic hell downtown!\"\n\\\n\"Admittedly I was a little worried that this place would be all sparkle and little substance but I was willing to trust the reviews and I'm glad I did.\\\nThe place is stunning and super warm, as are all the staff. Kind and knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing. I didn't have to fight to keep my last drop of wine or last bite of steak tartare in the interest of moving the table out.\\\nWe had the table side steak tartare which was good however I think the meat could have been ground a little more.\\\nThe table side Ceasar salad with amazing and the server shared a few tips to make the dressing absolutely perfect.\\\nThe ribeye was large enough to share which gave 2 of us the perfect melt in your mouth yummy amount that was cooked exactly as it should be.\\\nAs full as we were, we tried the buttercake which was a simple dessert but completely hit the spot.\\\nAll in all, it was a great night and I would go back again!\"\n\\\n\"Came to b&b for the first time and it was absolutely amazing. Tommy at the bar made us feel like we were right at home. The food and service was unbelievable. We will definitely be back!\\\nThanks guys!\"\n\\\nWow! This place is fantastic, the food was incredible and the vibe as well, I can\\'92t say enough about how fantastic the staff is, they really make you feel relaxed and at home.

The server  took really good care of us and pampered us till the end of the meal. I highly recommend this place, must try it at least once. Cheers\n\\\nFirst off let me start by saying everything here was absolutely fabulous to respond to some of the comments yes some of the cocktails take 15ish minutes to get to you but it's not a big deal they're very busy, food was fantastic 10/10 we had the wagyu,calamari,oysters and a few other things everything was 10/10 I've been to many high end establishments and black and blue lives up to its name anyone giving this place under 5 stars is a bum.(we had to go for the wagyu twice lol) plus 36$ for wagyu serves on a rock of salt with its sides is a complete steal! I'm honestly not over some of the people complaining the food and staff are amazing.\n\\\nPatricia was helping us and she was amazing. Great experience, great food, and the ambience was great. Loved the wagyu\n\\\nA great experience. Food was incredible, service was strong and our server took her time and explained everything to us. Overall amazing experience. We booked another reservation on the way out of the first\n\\\nOverall terrible experience.  I assumed a \\'93high end steakhouse\\'94 would come with amazing service but instead this was the worst service I\\'92ve had in my life.  Dropping dirty cutlery on my lap, pouring water on my girlfriend\\'92s plate of food, burnt brussels sprouts, cold $330 steak, took 40 mins for drinks, etc\\'85. Very sloppy service overall.  When i spoke to the manager his response was \\'93thanks for the feedback\\'94.\n\\\nThe food is amazing,service is fantastic\\uc0\\u10084 \\u65039 \n\\\nBeautiful new restaurant in the financial district. Steak was amazing and cooked just right. Nice decor and design. Definitely a great place to checkout. Servers were sharp and on the ball.\n\\\nBest birthday dinner ever! Thank you Tristan for the fabulous dinning experience. The food was excellent (Beef Wellington, steak, Mac and cheese sticks and fries). The cosmopolitan was so good! The butter cake was probably the best dessert I\\'92ve ever had. We will definitely be back.\n\\\nNice ambiance.  Service is 5/5. Food is good.\n\\\nCame in with two friends yesterday, the service was top notch, as well as the food & drinks. Best steakhouse I\\'92ve been to in Toronto. It\\'92s great to see a concept like this in the city! Excited to see how they evolve over the seasons.\n\\\n\"It's kinda wild how this place can be listed as a high end steak house but I got better service at kelseys.\\\n\\\nImagine a dining experience where the waiters are apparently trying to give you concussions with the plates.\\\n\\\nWhich is also funny considering a place based of taste and experience wouldn't even swap out my cutlery between dishes.

We showed up promptly at 7:05pm for the hostess to tell us that since the reservation wasn\\'92t confirmed (again after I had already booked it over the phone and seemed like it was confirmed then and there). I changed my phone number between this time and so they were unable to reach me to double confirm. The first hostess we spoke with assured us it\\'92s ok and they will still seat us, which was a relief UNTIL, Maria (the front hostess manager) stepped in and said with the most passive aggressive smile on her face, that she cannot seat us and she seemed like she wanted to tell us to go somewhere else. Then she said 30 minutes, 30 minutes passed by and told us to come back at 8:30pm. My party and I were FINALLY sat at 8:30pm. Once we were sat we had the most lovely experience, Andre our server was outstanding, fun, and charismatic, the food was prompt and by far the most delicious A5 Wagyu I\\'92ve had in Toronto. Around the table we each had A5 Wagyu 10/10, shared the crab cakes 9/10, carpaccio 9/10, table side steak tartar 6/10, Waldorf salad 10/10, salmon sashimi 10/10 this was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH \\uc0\\u55357 \\u56842 , lobster mashed potatoes, Burrata, asparagus, and Mac and cheese stick which I didn\\'92t try but looked fantastic. The sommelier was awesome and made sure that the bottle of Dom Perignon we ordered was as cold as possible by giving it a cold plunge before serving it, we were thrilled. I also had the Double Entendra cocktail and it was SO delicious 10/10 if you love Prosecco and passion fruit \\u55357 \\u56908 \\u55356 \\u57340 \\\n\\\nI wish I could have given this place more stars, however the experience we had at the front desk was very unprofessional and left and bad taste in my mouth - no pun intended. Washrooms also could have used more attention.\"\n\\\nWent in for a celebration dinner and I got to make a special note that the service was AMAZING. Very kind and lovely server. Food was good. Would overall go back for the ceasar salad and otoro sashimi. Also - there is a dress code so I would come dressed for the occasion otherwise the hostess in front will comment about it.\n\\\n\"Came here for the first time & expectations were blown.

We both opted for the lunch prix fixe menu for $45. Our orders were taken quite quickly after arriving, which was nice, and our appetizers were delivered in 5 minutes or less. We both chose the Crispy Calamari, which were just ok. They were more like squid fries; battered long thick pieces of squid with a tasty dipping sauce. I am more of a traditional fried calamari fan, with crispy rings and tentacles mixed in. Needless to say, despite the taste being decent, the esthetic was off for me. We then waited about 25 minutes for our main selection. This was noticed by who I assumed was the front of house manager who assured us that our meals were coming up shortly. My friend ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto and I the Stuffed Yorkie. The risotto seemed a bit liquid-y suggesting it was a bit rushed. The stuffed yorkie was a pretty decent portion, very filling after the calamari. The fries were crispy and tasty, but a bit too salty. When we received our bill, it was incorrect so we had to address it. Overall, I would probably give the restaurant another go, to see how well their steaks are done, but as of now it hasn't made my preferred go-to list.\n\\\n\"Stopped in for lunch with my gf on the suggestion of a foodie friend and I'm so glad I did.

Andrew, Connie, and Mike were all incredible. I\\'92ll definitely be back!\n\\\nGreat vibe and ambience. I was seated upstairs, intimate balcony table with a nice view of the lower level. My favourites were the tableside steak tartare, scallops and lobster mash. Service was friendly. It got busier towards later in the night. The tableside dishes are fun and entertaining.\n\\\n\"Weekend dinner service for 2 with reservations in advanced. Walking into Black & Blue, we were immediately impressed with the decor, ambiance, and atmosphere. We sat on the second floor looking down on the main floor. Our server Dan was attentive and welcoming. We were surprised & delighted with complimentary cocktails, it set the perfect start to our night. Food came within reasonable timing and was outstanding! Prime rib portion was generous, took home leftovers. The B&B cake is to die for! Between 4 cocktails, 2 apps, 1 entree, 1 cdn tenderloin, 3 sides, and dessert our total was roughly $400-$450 total including tip. We will be returning customers. Can't wait to go back!\\\n\\\nAccessible through the PATH on weekend was a bonus.\\\n\\\nHighly recommend for date night, business dinner with clients, and special occasions.\"\n\\\n\"Overall great experience from beginning to end. Hostess phone confirmation and ability to adjust our reservation to accommodate additional guest was very appreciated.\\\nLoved the staff but you were overstaffed on service floor. Various staff came asking the same questions: taking our order, drinks. Should have one appointed staff for the table and rest as support. Not a bad problem to have but will help clean up the customer experience. Each staff was very friendly, kind and knowledgeable of your offerings.\\\nThe food was on point! Wagyu strip loin was hands down our favorite along with the porterhouse and tomahawk. Loved the food service presentation at the table. Great touch with the welcome drink my father thoroughly enjoyed it. Good touch with the little stools for the purses and bags. Ambiance and decor is beautiful. Worth taking photos of the bar entry and wine collection. Impressive.\\\nAre there nights you play music? Will come again to try your prime rib. Crab cakes were divine. French onion soup was ok\\'85tasted a bit sour but good mix of cheese and bread. Shrimp cocktail was beautifully displayed and served. Sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable. Coat check had issues when we were leaving as the coat room door was locked. Hostess could not get access to anyone\\'92s jacket.\\\nNonetheless, congratulations.

We ordered a lot: the bread, calamari, French onion soup, 2 sushi rolls, Wild Mushroom Risotto, a 10 oz steak, a Caesar salad & the mac and cheese sticks. After 2 hours we only received our bread and soup. Our server got the sushi order wrong so when it arrived (took forever) it was wrong. We had to ask to cancel the calamari because we were getting tired. When the steak finally arrived (I think 2.5 hours into our meal) it was really salty. The salad dressing was really tangy it was just ok. We didn\\'92t even want dessert by the end of it we were so tired we just wanted to go home.\\\n\\\nThe only tasty option was really the bread it was amazing other than that the rest of the food was meh. To be fair we did go on a Friday night & it was really busy. The worst part is we asked for our Mac and cheese sticks to be packed and went for them for a late night snack only to find out our server didn\\'92t pack them. We tipped 25% because our server did take a few things off our bill so why did he forget our Mac and cheese :(\"\n\\\nThe food was amazing the service was exceptional! Thank you Fase, Sebastian, Tyler. And Chef Henry for making my birthday dinner extra special!!\n\\\n\"I was there for lunch during week.  My initial impression of the place is that it looked great.  The decor was nice and the lighting was nice with lots of natural lighting.  I sat at the bar and it was a great spot to be able to watch the care and attention to detail the sushi chefs put into each plate that was going out.\\\n\\\nI went with the steak frites and had the calamari to start.\\\nThe calamari tasted great and the size of the order was really good.  The steak was cooked to perfection and the flavour was great. I didn't finish the fries and found that the order provided more than enough food.\\\n\\\nThe service was outstanding.  The servers, the manager and the sushi chef all took time to make poor water or make sure i was doing alright.  I had my laptop bag with me and they had a small platform to ensure my laptop bag was not on the floor.  I saw a review earlier that a lower ranking because of service but I think they sorted things out as the service was outstanding.  Definitely a new option for me to have lunch and host lunches at.\"\n\\\nSuch mediocre food. Ordered an onion soup, beef Wellington and a butter cake towards the end and honestly, nothing to rave about here. The onion soup has such a distinct aftertaste and the butter cake was way too sweet. Ordered a cappuccino along with the dessert which took almost 20 minutes to arrive (after a friendly nudge to the staff). For a premium steakhouse, the service was perhaps 5/10. And that\\'92s really all what the 2 stars are for. Merely ambience is not enough to satisfy the clientele at a restaurant - the food has to be top notch too!\n\\\nAmazing service and food. My new favourite spot in Toronto.\n\\\nFood was great but there was a lack with the service. They just recently open so I will give them a 2nd chance in a few months.

The staff were very attentive. Our server, Trevor, went above and beyond to assure that everything was to perfection.\\\nI highly recommend this resteraunt for any occasion. We will definitely be visiting this new hot spot often.\"\n\\\nCame here for drinks with my wife yesterday after work, food and drink was delicious, the atmosphere is so unique, inviting, luxurious unlike other steakhouses in Toronto. Kristin (sorry if I'm mistaking her name) the host at the front took such good care of us! She was so accommodating, we had to wait a bit so we got sent prosecco, she is so smiley and warm, will definitely be back\n\\\nAmazing experience!!! The staff really set this place apart, they were so totally attentive and on the ball with every need you could think of. The place was pretty busy and yet we wanted for nothing. The food was also delicious, filling, creative, beautiful plated and just so pretty. 10/10 experience!!! My group loved Conny, he was funny and very personable.\n\\\nAmazing customer service from Conny! We absolutely loved the table side Caesar salad (so fresh!!!), the warm freshly baked bread, pasta and visually stunning desserts. An artful, upscale edition to the Financial District area. Beautiful interiors that feel very grand. The kind and welcoming staff really make an impression. Conny, Charles and Ava were all treasures in our night.\n\\\nDan was incredible, he was so attentive and friendly. The food was incredible wagyu steak melted in your mouth, the brioche bread was heaven. Only thing wasn\\'92t the biggest fan was the Caesar salad I found it lacking flavour and needed garlic.\n\\\n\"Was there for dinner with my wife on Monday Apr 24th, 4pm reservation.\\\nFood tasted amazing however we both were sick that night. Terrible diarrhea... Started cramping up a few hours after the meal and continued for most of the night. My wife was nauseous and had diarrhea as well.\\\nWe both went to bed early and woke up with headaches and dizziness.might book a doctors appointment.\\\nWe ordered the prime rib, Lobster carbanara, Cesar salad, 6 oysters and a couple of beers and glasses of wine.\\\nWas a great birthday dinner that turned rotten. A 260 dollar awful night.\"\n\\\nMy prediction: This will become the \"go to\" steakhouse in Toronto. Plenty of staff...service is great. Food was delicious, creative. Beautiful space. Amazing meal.
