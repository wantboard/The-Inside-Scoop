This spot specializes in 2 types of Broth, Nibo-Men is prepared with Dried Sardine, Bonito and Kelp, so the Broth is sweeter, with the addition of a clean spiciness, the tiny bit of kick made it so heartwarming; Buta-Men Jiro Style is prepared with Pork Fat so the Broth is super THICK, topped with a piece of melt-in-your-mouth Pork Belly, Bean Sprout, Cabbage, paired with their Chewy, Thick Noodles that the Soup clinged on to! We tried one of each and GOSH were these Ramen Bowls special, so incredibly RICH, and flavourful! The Egg that it came with was also a MUST, perfect Soft Boiled Marinated Egg, can you say no to this? Their Chicken Karaage was INSANELY juicy, the Chicken was so tender, perfectly seasoned and deep fried to perfection, dipped in their Negi Scallion Shio Lemon Sauce, a light and refreshing pairing for the Chicken!\n\\\nThe soup is so good, we started with takoyaki, and for the main are ajitama regular and spicy ramen. The online menu can be tricky for first time user, sometimes you have to click the option twice to add.\n\\\n\"Ramen Buta-Nibo does ramen jiro-style. I had no idea what this style was, but having tried it, will now be a go-to of mine. The noodles are thick and chewy, the pork broth is really rich, and there's a garlic paste that you can mix in that makes the pork slices and broth even tastier. Yum!\\\n\\\nAlso tried:\\\n- Nibo-men: While more traditional, I actually liked how the dried sardine gave the broth a different taste.\\\n- Truffle miso mayo takoyaki: Pretty good, though would have liked a stronger truffle miso taste.\\\n\\\nIt's soft opening so they're ironing out things.

They are mainly credit/debit only and ordering is done on a digital menu, so best if one person coordinates the order.\"\n\\\nThe Ajitama Original Ramen was quite a filling experience... One can order light or richer broths, fatty meat, and garlic levels. The noodles are fatter than the usual ramen restaurants' style here in Toronto. Karaage chicken wasn't bad and comes with a dipping sauce, but pricier than other competitors. The real star of the place though is the shoyu niboshi ramen taste. The broth is lighter than the regular pork flavour, and the noodles are also of the thinner variety. Comparable to the clam-based taste of Konjiki Ramen and Kyouka Ramen. Japanese-speaking staff.\n\\\nWonderful ramen with friendly staff. Everything is customizable which is great once you know what portions you want - some more guidance with the menu would be helpful. Quickly becoming a popular spot and a welcome addition to the Danforth.\n\\\nThe broth was rich, tasty, deep. The noodles thick, fresh, al-dente. One can choose extra garlic, bean, pork, spice, treated-egg. Thank God to our answered prayers!\n\\\n\"Located at the intersection of Carlaw and Danforth (near Pape Station), Ramen Buta-Nibo is owned by the same group behind Ryus Noodle Bar near Broadview Station. Their specialty is the \"\"Jiro-Style\"\" ramen, which features a big serving of vegetables and ingredients on top of thick, chewy noodles. This type of ramen, also known as \"\"Jirolian style\"\" is common in Tokyo that was popularized by Ramen Jiro.\\\n\\\nUpon entering the restaurant, guests are welcomed by friendly staff members who inform them that the establishment is cashless, with payment accepted via credit or debit card. The menu is easily accessible via a QR code, making it convenient for patrons to peruse the selection of dishes. They prefer one order for the whole table so that they can organize it easier for the kitchen. The staff were very friendly and asked us if there were allergies upon handing us utensils and water.\\\n\\\nOne of the standout features of Ramen Buta-Nibo is the generous portion sizes. This is a great value for the price (averages $20 per ramen), as customers essentially get two meals for the price of one. The sheer volume of toppings is impressive and serves as a heartier, more filling meal. They have two different types of soup bases, the Buta (pork) broth which is rich and heavy with oils and fats and the Nibo (niboshi/dried sardines) broth which is a lighter and clear broth. Our table ordered several Buta-ramen that we customized from broth, fat, toppings, vegetable, seasoned fat, and garlic paste. We all loved our dishes from the Original Ramen, Ajitama Original Ramen, Black Garlic Ramen and Ajitama Black Garlic Ramen. Their ramen comes with a large portion of thick noodles, pile of garlic paste, cha-siu (braised pork belly), seasoned fat and lots of boiled vegetables (bean sprouts, cabbage,", "doc_id": "9d2d83af-b436-4068-a540-f77c1ce54b29", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "206fdf4e190b940ebd9817284ab65503d827fb276f02bb0d648877641c4df6fd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2618, "end": 6361}, "relationships": {"1": "69eef256-f8ca-4278-a98b-9152e1461c43", "2": "acd70de4-0251-48a7-ad55-49754fbb71a4", "3": "81f2915f-4489-4430-acc1-d73809bfbdf5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "81f2915f-4489-4430-acc1-d73809bfbdf5": {"__data__": {"text": "is impressive and serves as a heartier, more filling meal.

We ordered the small Boneless Chicken Thigh (Karaage) with Umami Shio flavour and Spicy Mayo sauce. Also, it came with a tiny side of pickled cabbage. You can customize the Karaage for the flavour, dipping sauce and additional topping. which comes in small, medium, large or x-large.

The seafood smell was very potent.\"\n\\\nJust saw this new ramen stop along Danforth Avenue and said to myself that we will try this one at some point. Me and better half went here on our anniversary and they didn\\'92t disappointment on the ramen. We ordered the Ajitama Original Ramen and the Ajitama Spicy Ramen and both tasted so good that at the end we were feeling so full with the serving. Place has a rustic & industrial design and staff are really accommodating.  Price-wise is at par with similar ramen restaurant. Definitely coming back and highly recommended to all to come and have a taste of the first Jiro Ramen in Toronto. Just google what Jiro style ramen is and you will get here what wiki defines Jiro Ramen. As as side note, this place is supervised by Ryus Noodle Bar located at Broadview & Danforth Ave which is also a must try place for traditional ramen.\n\\\n\"I ate here yesterday with my girlfriend.

It's easily the best ramen in the neighborhood (but considering there's low competition in the area -- at least as far as ramen goes). The ramen was delicious and broth was deeply satisfying. The place gets busy quick, so if you are coming during peak hours, you may have to add your name to the wait list.\n\\\nThe ramen is ok.  We ordered to 4 lb noodle and noticed that by the time we are half way done,  the noodles gets cold.  I would suggest to order 2 separate regular ramen instead.\n\\\nChicken karaage  not bad, truffle miso takoyaki very special taste worth trying! Mega mori ramen too much bean sprout  a bit heavy taste! Will try other favours ramen next time !\n\\\nSo good! On par with ramen I had in Japan. The veggies tasted so fresh, the broth was delicious and the portion size was more than generous. I had the vegetarian and my husband had the Mega Miro and it was HUGE! This is now my favourite ramen spot in Toronto, definitely coming back.\n\\\n\"I recently visited a Buta-Nibo where I ordered the Jiro style original and it was fantastic! The broth was rich and smokey and the thick charsiu was so tender and delicious. The noodles were also great - they were nice and thick with a good chew to them. The portions were very large, so if you're a noodle monster like me, this is the perfect dish for you! I also loved the peppery and garlic flavor of the broth - it added a nice kick to the dish. Overall, a fantastic dining experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves ramen.\\\n\\\nThe service is efficient, and it's a cashless operation.\"\n\\\n\"Overall a great Jiro-like (\\uc0\\u20108 \\u37070 \\u31995 ) ramen experience in Toronto.\\\n\\\nThe differences between an actual Jiro-Ramen in Japan and the one here is that the broth are lighter, there are Karaage Fried Chickens on the noodles, and the noodles are slightly thinner.\\\n\\\nThe taste of the gyoza dumplings were average, but the outer layer/ wrap were harder than some of the gyoza dumplings in Toronto.\"\n\\\n\"Heard about this place from Toronto Food on IG and it did not disappoint.\\\n\\\nThe joint was busy and the ambiance is modern.

Had the karaage and Jiro style ramen. The karaage was big pieces of juicy chicken with a very thin layer of batter so it's not heavy at all, very good! The ramen was sooooo full it was literally spilling over the bowl! The pork was thick cut (and some small chunks), the ramen noodles were thick and had a good texture, there was a ton of bean sprouts (so if you don't like them well too bad), and a massive scoop of garlic (you can opt for less but we went for the regular for the full experience for this first time). Oh right! Almost forgot the pork fat! Hahahaa that was also a  delicious topping! But ummm... I guess if you're health conscious then beware?\\\nOverall large portion, reasonable prices, bursts of wonderful flavour. Very good very good.\"\n\\\nWe got the original ramen, with all the regular toppings including the egg. The rich broth is SO good, but I would suggest doing the options of less for veg & garlic. The regular is SO good but it is very garlicky. The veg option is also huge so come hungry! The meat was tender and cooked beautifully, the egg was delicious! Will be back to try the fried chicken but waiting for liquor license first.\n\\\nEven tho the service was rather cold and the e-menu not very user-friendly for first-time customers, it would be unfair to give this restaurant less than 5 stars. The broth of the pork jiro ramen was sublime. Very strong, long-lasting flavor, definitely worth the ride to Pape just for that. I also really enjoyed the cha-shu, nicely charred and the noodles were excellent too, think and chewy. The shoyu ramen also had a very tasty fish dashi broth. Both options highly recommended\n\\\nThis place is legit. Broth is on point. Jiro style is stacked with all of the good stuff you expect. Good crew that treats you well. Eat here. You won\\'92t regret it. There\\'92s no doubt this will become a destination.\n\\\nDelicious Ramen! First jiro style ramen in toronto!

The fried chicken is the best out of all the foods we ordered. It's juicy and perfectly cooked. The takoyaki was not good, overpriced, and it's one of the brands you can get in asian grocery stores. The Ramen were so bad, one of the worst in toronto. The soup was greasy, the noodle was hard, not chewy, and the egg was overcooked. It has lots of cheap bean sprouts. Would rather go for Pho with that price and quality.\n\\\nOne of the few places that I had given 5 stars to in all categories.

The Karaage alone is worth checking out, but the Jiro style ramen is a nice twist on the different types that you get around the city. I describe it as rich and garlicky with a generous amount of toppings. As always, friendly, attentive service and kid-friendly. A welcome addition to the souvlaki strip!\n\\\nUsed to go to Ryu\\'92s when they were still at Baldwin. I decided to try their Jiro style Ramen. I prefer the Ryu ones. Jiro style is huge even when I order Regular portion. Thick garlicky tonkotsu broth. I like the thick tonkotsu, not really diggin the garlic. I\\'92ll probably return for the Ryu ramen though. I also got the chashu ramen mini donburi. It was surprisingly very good curry.\n\\\nDelicious ramen - Ryus and now this place (an offshoot from Ryus?) are the only ramen shops I want to eat at here in Toronto. The flavour of the different broths are unbeatable, and the service is good. The only thing to improve is maybe the consistency of the chashu (once it was overcooked and a bit chewy) but that hasn't cropped up for me more than once so I'm hoping that was a fluke. Definitely check this place out if you love ramen!\n\\\nGreat place for ramen. Portion sizes are quite large, so be careful when adding extras as they aren't really necessary. Great service and good location. Noodles and broth were good.\n\\\n\"As far from \\'91the usual\\'92 as you can get. The nibomen is a clear, deep, anchovy driven broth with a suite of classic toppings.\\\n\\\nThe Jiro style butamen is a glorious porky, garlicy and fatty affair.

Yhe Ramen is amazing.  But you have to order from an app, and I've felt rushed out before.   So it's good if you're in a rush, but not if you want to relax and enjoy a meal.   The staff interaction is minimal, so it's kind of a mix of takeout and restaurant.  I tipped low for this reason.  To me part of the point of going to a restaurant is the personal interaction - not so you can order off of an app.  They also don't take cash - so I feel like I need to cater to the restaurant and not the other way around.\n\\\nThe Danforth is getting better and better with new food spots!

For $13 more than their regular ramen, you get 2 pieces of karaage, small bits of extra pork, and the rest is just bean sprouts. Sure, a bean sprout mountain is a staple of jiro style ramen, but what you're getting is not really worth $40 after taxes, and that's without the extra $1 to $2.5 to make it spicy. They could've at least included an egg and even then, you can get an Ajitama (egg) ramen plus 4 pieces of karaage for ~$26 before tax, which costs less than the Mega Mori and nets you more proteins (sans the bean sprouts).\\\n\\\nAlso, it was odd that each table could only order through a single phone. Other restaurants using Snappy never had that limitation.\\\n\\\nBut the ramen itself was pretty good. Nice thick noodles and flavorful broth. Karaage is advertised as their specialty, and is definitely a highlight. Just pretend the Mega Mori doesn't exist on the menu. They need to redo the math on that one.\"\n\\\n\"(Translated by Google) Another friend and I went for the sumo ramen, the most expensive ramen in the store.\\\nAs soon as it is on the table, it is a hill-like ramen, a lot of \\uc0\\u55358 \\u56681  and side dishes. Japanese-style fried chicken, char siu pork, bean sprouts, cabbage, braised bamboo shoots, minced meat and a huge lump of raw garlic.\\\nThere are so many bean sprouts, enough to fill two small bowls. While holding it, I thought, why are they all bean sprouts, where are the noodles\\uc0\\u10067 \\\nThe ramen at the bottom has a good taste and strength\\uc0\\u10071 \\u65039 The soup of the ramen is very thick, and the side dishes are rich in taste, and the portion is really big. If a boy can barely finish eating, he will be very full.\\\n\\uc0\\u10055 \\u65039 I generally feel that the taste is good, but it is a matter of opinion whether it is worth the price.
