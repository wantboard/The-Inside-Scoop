There is a hype and the hype is real/legit. If you truly want to experience NYC pizza, this place must be on your list. Ingredients are fresh and pizza is thin with a nice crispy crust. Cheese had the perfect melted consistency and stretch.  I would highly recommend adding peppers and pepperoni to your pie (gives the pie a nice flavor). One pizza is definitely big enough for three individuals . No reservations, cash only, and BYOB (there are plenty of liquor stores near by so pick up a bottle of wine prior to dinner). You must come to the location prior to opening to get a reservation for a table. There will be a line around the block if you try to come at 5:00 PM and you most likely will only get a late reservation  for a table. If you do get in line, you\u2019ll have to make sure you get there early enough to get a table before 11 PM.  Customer service is outstanding and all the waiters/waitresses were super friendly.\nExceptional\nStill top of the pizza food chain even with all the amazing pizza we have in NYC. I've been coming here for many years and its always quality, a constant reminder. With that in mind, if you're visiting from our of town i recommend you eat pizza everywhere in Brooklyn - it will seldom disappoint.\nEveryone knows about the 4 hour wait but imo it's GREAT pizza but not worth the 4 hour wait.  If they somehow can make the wait time for take out less than an hour it would be ideal and 5 stars.\nUnreal pizza, worth the wait\nAbsolutely outstanding! Pizza was first class, and you can't miss the calzone - incredible. Service was perfect and the atmosphere and vibe were warm, relaxing, and cozy without being cramped. Do whatever you need to do to get here or, if you've been before, to get back.\n\"We took a friends reservation last minute, showed up a little late and a little drunk, didn\u2019t realize it was cash only (but thankfully we had enough cash) and then we kept talking after closing until they very nicely asked us to leave, which we immediately did.\n\nWouldn\u2019t have changed a thing - they were so kind, our waitress gave us very appreciated help on what toppings to choose. The pizza and calzone were both 10/10\"\nThe pizza is amazing here and the service is one of a kind. I strongly recommend eating here whenever you have a chance.\nWaited an hour in line to tells me that the next available table is in 6 hours. This is ridiculous. This is overrated place!!!!\nPizza that's nearly perfect. The sauce was just right with plenty of seasoning and garlic. The crust was light and foldable yet crispy, the cheese just right (not heavy), and the fresh basil stalks after cooking the pie added the perfect accompaniment\n\"Of all of New York\u2019s pizza spots, perhaps none is more hyped than Lucali\u2019s. After reading through article after article full of praise, I decided it was a must try, and my friend and I made the trek to Carroll Gardens. We arrived at 5:15pm but even then were informed we were too late for dine in, and that the closest takeout time was at 9pm. Determined, we added our names to the list.\n\nBy the time we arrived several hours later we had become well acquainted with Carroll Gardens' charming, tree lined streets and watched a splendid sunset over Manhattan right by the water. Nonetheless, we were very hungry, and given the wait, and the fact only takeout was available for a $35 pizza, we agreed that it might have to be the best pizza we\u2019d ever had to justify the ordeal.\n\nWith a wait time of another 15 minutes for our pizza to finally be ready we had the opportunity to get a feel for Lucali\u2019s vibe, seemingly more see and be seen than charming neighborhood spot. With the pizza finally in hand we hastily found a nearby bench and unveiled our cherished pie.\n\nThe pizza is unquestionably delicious, with a", "doc_id": "fc178168-cba3-4f86-80bf-aa42e31279e4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5fa6abd6e71cdbcca5c238f446292489c64cadccaf4aea6a76cd9bcc2896da15", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3825}, "relationships": {"1": "74b580da-4b3e-4825-8b93-34b8587e76b8", "3": "1b7f4ac7-603d-4333-8b5e-316b03fc0f04"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b7f4ac7-603d-4333-8b5e-316b03fc0f04": {"__data__": {"text": "the time we arrived several hours later we had become well acquainted with Carroll Gardens' charming, tree lined streets and watched a splendid sunset over Manhattan right by the water.

With the pizza finally in hand we hastily found a nearby bench and unveiled our cherished pie.\n\nThe pizza is unquestionably delicious, with a delectably charred, thin and crispy base that pairs well with the natural sweetness of high quality tomatoes and accentuated by a generous grating of parmesan and the freshness of basil. Despite appearing flat, the crust was airy and light, and I thoroughly enjoyed each and every slice of pizza.\nGiven our mutual satisfaction, we were left with a decision to make. Overall, Lucali\u2019s pizza was not the best I had in New York. Coupled with the aforementioned wait time and takeout only method of consumption, I am probably not in a rush to return.\"\nTop pizza in NY\nSome of the best pizza in NYC.\nWorth the wait and the hype.\nPizza was great and a huge portion. The server was very helpful but the waiting time is so long! You have time to make a round of the city!\nWish we could have tried it but it's near impossible without waiting 3 0r four hours\nAs per people's explanation, we lined up on a Saturday at 3:30pm. We got our names listed by 4:00 for a dinner table at 10pm. So intense. We got in at around 10:30pm and least to say, my appetite wasn't in the mood anymore for pizza. I would have to say the calzone is life changing but the pizza is just ok. Not worth that wait honestly. Good thing we saw Ed Sheeran come out of the resto because that experience changed our lives\n\"The place is like being in a movie - dimly lit, romantic, great music, brick oven.  Super cool.  You'll likely have a long wait so go early when they open and lock in a spot (they only take reservations in person).  But you'll be able to return at your reservation time, not like you have to wait in-person for your table.\n\nThe pizza was epic and the ingredients were super-fresh.  But the calzone stole the show.  I've had pizza that was close to this but never a calzone that was this epic.  You will eat well here.\"\nRecommended by a friend and it was a surprisingly amazing experience getting to sit and eat their magnificent dishes even though they don\u2019t have a wide option of food like the Miami branch has. I really love the calzone! The staffs and service were friendly and great, they even helped us with their house recommendations and would love to explain to us whenever we have questions in mind. The place was super packed on Saturday evening even if we booked the place, we gotta wait for another hour which was worth it. We even brought home unfinished pizza slices and reheated them the next morning, they were still magnificent af! I left the place with a big smile on my face, no kidding! Hahah :)\nThe best pizza in NYC if you can get a table\nTook a $30 cab to find out it was closed today. There were other people there as well and all they had was a sign in the front of the stall, and later we found out an IG post that was posted around the time we were there.\nDisappointing. Not as great as I hoped.\nLittle contribution is needed from this review to convince you whether you should go here or not.

Although what did it for me believe it or not was not the food that was only a fraction of why I like lucali.  it was the music I love music from the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s. So basically that\u2019s the reason why I personally like lucali. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else but myself. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nThe pizza is pretty amazing here and they have an awesome topping selection too.

The menu is straightforward: pizza or calzones.  Plus the place is BYOB.  We had an amazing meal and experience.\n\"Pizza is simply amazing, by far the best in the country. My wife and I are pizza lovers and quite particular when it comes to pizza.\n\nThe ambiance is great also. Be sure to get there early to set your reservation in person.\n\nBYOB as well.\"\nI was unsure about waiting in line to make a reso but it was definitely worth it. Pizza was great and calzones were the best that I ever had!\nWe arrived just after 2pm on a Saturday and were the 3rd group in line. At 4pm, they begin taking reservations - they let you choose your time from 5pm, and ask you to return 5 minutes before. We got a table for 6 at 7pm (sat around 7:10pm). Seating is a strict 1 hour, and you are allowed to bring your own alcohol. Other reviews say 1 bottle per table, but they allow as much as you like as long as you are off the table by the end of your hour. They'll open the wine for you. Food is delicious - the perfect Neapolitan pizza, the plain is so good. Don't miss the calzone too! Recommend 3 pizzas + 1 calzone for 6 people, and they come out one at a time. $39 for plain pizza, and $32 for small calzone.\n\"(Translated by Google) The place is small and crowded\nBefore we go, we made our reservation by phone.\n\nThe service is good, but not the best or the nicest\n\nOur request:\nMargherita pizza is honestly delicious, the dough is thin and light, and the size of the pizza is large enough for two people comfortably\n\nNote: they have pepperoni with beef\n\n(Original)\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0645\u0632\u062f\u062d\u0645\n\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0646\u0631\u0648\u062d \u062d\u062c\u0632\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0648\u0646\u060c\n\n\u0627\u0644\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0647", "doc_id": "987bc3a1-380b-40e7-b6b3-4fe65f23f872", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4933b5a310d1ce8d852cbed34981751620593458a1e44c5e0924981ffbe59e42", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7064, "end": 10589}, "relationships": {"1": "74b580da-4b3e-4825-8b93-34b8587e76b8", "2": "1b7f4ac7-603d-4333-8b5e-316b03fc0f04", "3": "38415e9e-00cd-4040-9abd-a2ac19d57f21"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "38415e9e-00cd-4040-9abd-a2ac19d57f21": {"__data__": {"text": "+ 1 calzone for 6 people, and they come out one at a time. $39 for plain pizza, and $32 for small calzone.\n\"(Translated by Google) The place is small and crowded\nBefore we go, we made our reservation by phone.\n\nThe service is good, but not the best or the nicest\n\nOur request:\nMargherita pizza is honestly delicious, the dough is thin and light, and the size of the pizza is large enough for two people comfortably\n\nNote: they have pepperoni with beef\n\n(Original)\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0645\u0632\u062f\u062d\u0645\n\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0646\u0631\u0648\u062d \u062d\u062c\u0632\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0648\u0646\u060c\n\n\u0627\u0644\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0643\u0648\u064a\u0633\u0647 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\n\n\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627:\n\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0632\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u063a\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u064a\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062c\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u0631\u0647\u064a\u0641\u0647 \u0648\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641\u0647 \u0648\u062d\u062c\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0632\u0627 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0647\n\n\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638\u0629 : \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\"\n\"Amazing traditional and neighborhood pizza place holding the name of the owner.\nBe ready to wait in line, there is no reservation online.\nWent with with family on a weekday and the food taste delicious.

We booked a table for 4, ordered 1 pie with pepperoni and onions, 2 cheese pies, and a small calzone. You can taste the fresh ingredients, especially the cheese and the basil \ud83d\udc4c. That cheese pull on the calzone was ridiculous. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys the simplicity of a pizza where the crust, the sauce, and the cheese all work well together.\n\nThe service was very attentive and welcoming. It's BYOB and they provide cups for your convenience. There's a rustic ambiance with a candle lit table where you can see them make the pizza in front of you with a wine bottle.\n\nThe queue can be long, which going early and picking a timeslot is highly recommended.\n\nCame here twice and would come back for a third and many more time.\"\nI waited on the line many times; I love it and do not mind the wait.\nGood pizza but the calzone was the best part\n\"I absolutely love this place. The pizza, the cheese, the sauce, the basil - everything just hits differently.

The calzone is an absolute MUST. Probably the best calzone I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThe line is very very long. I\u2019ve been here twice and learned that the best way to get a decent reservation time slot is probably coming at around 2pm. I also enjoyed coming with a large party, so we can take turns waiting in line & also order more food to try. With a party of 6, we killed 3 pizzas and a large calzone haha. Also BYOB so bring your wine :-)\"\nFood excellent. Service excellent. Red rope for pizza and calzones a little off putting but i get it. The flexi straw definitely brought me back and made my dinner delicious. Still a little too high brow for me.  Someone shared this pic of their dinner.

People in line before where told 1 table 1 hour time.\n\nOverall disappointing experience.\"\n\"Solid pizza! Is it worth the hassle of waiting in line for a reservation and then coming back later? Probably not. If someone else waits for you and makes the reservation but they\u2019re a no fuss all pizza kind of place.\n\nThe pizza we had was a little soggy but we were told it was not usually like this. Visit the local shop and decide for yourself!\"\nDelicious but overpriced. If you are not budget conscious though go for it you won\u2019t regret it!\nThey have a great menu and their prices are reason able too. I recommend trying them out when you have a chance.\nThe best ever and the real secret is get the calzone\nCame all the way from Europe to try this absolutely fantastic pie! Never had a better calzone in our lives! On top of that, the atmosphere was super cozy, staff incredibly friendly and even the owner came by personally to ask if we were enjoying our pizza. What an experience!\nPizza was average at best, tried it out because of the high rating pretty disappointed. Not enough cheese on the pizza.\nI\u2019m a born and raised New Yorker and this was the best pizza I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Legendary.\nIf you want to take someone on a date, this is the place to go. Put your name on the list early, then hang out in the neighborhood til you get called. The pizza is still just as good as ever. Mark (mr lucali) is a super nice dude too!\nReally good pizza, great ambiance. Service was decent. They do need more than 2 pitchers of water for establishment of this size. Since not everyone on our table was drinking wine, those who chose to stick to water were parched at times.\nThe food is amazing here and the way they make their pizza is amazing. I recommend trying them out whenever you have a chance.\nExcellent pizza and atmosphere. Happy 2000th review!\nAn expensive pizza that taste like a $1 dollar pizza, don\u2019t waste your money in this place!\nBest pizza on the planet\nNot terrible.\nThe Pizza was very good but the waiting time was ridiculous.. we waited 4 hrs to get seated. Why making people wait so long..??? they should take reservations instead of making people wait out in the cold for hourssss.. specially those like us who were tourists and traveling to Brooklyn just to eat at your restaurant.. last but not least, the customer service was bad...\nThe experience was great and the pizza was good.

I went a hour before they open and waited in line for about 20 mins to book a reservation in person and got a reservation for 8pm that day.\nAmazing pizza but I probably wouldn\u2019t wait in line again. We waited an hour to get a 11pm reservation in super cold snowy weather. The pizza tasted amazing and fresh but honestly the whole experience of waiting in the cold wasn\u2019t worth the hype, if that makes sense. Still a great pizza place.\nEating pizza here is an experience!!!\nFood was great, but the experience was not thanks to the host. Let me tell you why...We waited in line at 2:30 PM to make a reservation for 5 at 8 only to be told that they would call us after 8:30 when our table was about to be ready. The call arrived at 8:57 stating that our table was ready and the hour would begin at 9. 3 of us managed to arrive 15 minutes later after letting the host know our ETA. As soon as we sat down the host demanded our order consisting of 2 pies. She advised that 2 would not be enough for 5, so we ordered another 2. The place is tiny and the pies are huge, so they could only be served one at a time. Only 2 came out in the next 40 minutes, so when the third was on the way the host returned and stated that our time was up. \"You can order more, but you'll have to wait for them outside.\" I can understand turning tables over to get people in and out, but the other four tops around us were not being rushed out the door and were all seated before us. With no choice but to leave we paid our bill and got up from the table. As we departed I gestured to the host that we were up and the the table was free. She returned the \"gesture\" with a shooing motion and stated \"good, get the f*** outta here\" in true NYer fashion.  The $32 pizza is good, but definitely not worth spending the middle of your day in line and hanging around for a call.\nIf you want to experience 1800\u2019s racism, this is the right spot. Treated very badly by the hostess. Saw the other reviews after visiting the spot, they have faced similar experience by the same person taking the reservation.\n\"Its a good pizza but really not up to the hype, not even close.\n\nOn the other hand their calzones are great, probably the best I've had. Get the calzone.\"\nlife changing\njust another over priced pizza joint. nothing, more... nothing less\nI ordered pizza with jalapenos and pepperoni as toppings, the jalapenos complimented the marinara very well. The flavour was subtle, and the pie was baked perfectly with the classic char at the bottom. I loved it !!!\nBest Pizza I've ever had. The line is a pain.. I recommend you get there no later than 3pm to get get your name in.\n\"The food was perfect,\nbut the lady outside taking bookings and our waitress was verystereotypical\"\nAmazing food. Mark is such a nice guy too! All of his staff are as well. Gonna become a regular \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd\nBest pizza I\u2019ve ever had! The line and reservation wait time was part of the experience. The hype is real\nGot in line at 3pm, took names at 4pm, seated at 5pm!\nThis place is not worth the wait and the hassle, don\u2019t waste your time.\nIt", "doc_id": "ed60468c-ed16-44f6-ba83-463e485aa275", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "810d0cfde787f7c73f44dc8533e476fde3d88a3295aaf027856d7238a6ff42cd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 21419, "end": 25222}, "relationships": {"1": "74b580da-4b3e-4825-8b93-34b8587e76b8", "2": "54234b29-9bbc-4dd7-8ddf-8c1c36be0f7f", "3": "fdb08df8-497d-44c5-96e5-a11d8a220d35"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdb08df8-497d-44c5-96e5-a11d8a220d35": {"__data__": {"text": "very well.

Waited 30 minutes around 4:00PM to make a reservation for 9:00PM. We still waited about 15 minutes for our table when we arrived, but what an experience. The sauce and crust are everything. Servers, cooks and Mark are all so polite and humble.\n\"The wait system is Deceiving here . They say they put you in queue , but it's always one who is standing in front gets the table first.\nThe usher is impolite to deal with.\n\nPizza's are fine , but certainly not worth the wait.\nLook for other spots like Lindustrie etc.\"\nAbsolutely stunning! We were lucky to get in without a wait. This truly is the best pizza in Carroll Gardens.\nSublime\u2764\ufe0f\n\"The best pizza in NYC.  Full stop.\n\nIt\u2019s a no-frills place (cash only, BYOB) with only pizza and a calzone on the menu, but boy is it worth it.  You\u2019ll need to arrive early to get a table, but there\u2019s not much more to say other than enjoy!\"\nWhat can you say when something has SO MUCH HYPE that it can\u2019t live up to it\u2026 but it does?! It\u2019s stupid good. It\u2019s frustratingly charming, and warm, and lovely inside, and the food is simply world class. Each pizza (we got 4!) was better than the last. Each was in the top few pizzas I\u2019ve ever eaten. I don\u2019t understand why it is so magical, but it just is.\nPizza was average and there wasn\u2019t any kind of italian Flair. I have eaten better Pizza\u2019s in New York. The stuff is very unfriendly. I don\u2018t recommend that Place.\nBad experience in this overrated restaurant and can\u2018t recommend it. The pizza is average and on the same level than many other pizzas in New York - it isn\u2018t worth to drive to this remote place. They just accept cash, no credit cards. The employees and their service are very poor. We saw that the employees closed the doors before the official opening times. The employees (see picture) start to clean the cutlery next to your table. In general you don\u2019t feel first as a customer and the atmosphere is very cold.\nI had the pleasure of coming here solo on a Sunday night. The pizza was so good, it brought me to tears. This is not an exaggeration.\n\"I didn\u2019t know cheese pizza could taste this magnificent.\n\nSuch a great experience. Get there at 3p  enjoy the front porch. It\u2019s a beautiful street. There\u2019s a bodega and sushi place on the block if you need a quick hold ya over. I think it\u2019s worth fasting for the pizza myself.\n\nThis place is special. Eating the food here is special. I\u2019m thankful for this place. Good people making not just good food, but good memories for  friends and families to cherish forever.\"", "doc_id": "fdb08df8-497d-44c5-96e5-a11d8a220d35", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a887369ad498d577fdcb2477afff02fc79199a14defdf5b2d11a535516d816de", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 25185, "end": 28387}, "relationships": {"1": "74b580da-4b3e-4825-8b93-34b8587e76b8", "2": "ed60468c-ed16-44f6-ba83-463e485aa275"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
