I went here 5 times already.\nPretty good food. The place is a cozy small spot. The bartenders are really friendly and helpful. The stand out dishes were the cod fritters and the ricotta with sourdough. The sourdough was great to go with that ricotta cheese covered in ramps and black trumpets. Would definitely reorder those. I did want more flavor from the other two dishes in the shrimp and the strawberry tart but they were still good.\nAvoid bar seating. And definitely no standing room unless you like to eat like a horse.\nabsolutely love it here! the food is incredible, the menu changes often, and the wine is top-notch. the corn agnolotti is out of this world. the pavlova was perfect. great spot for a light lunch, come for dinner with a couple people and order a bunch of the small plates to share.\nFour Horsemen is my favorite restaurant in the world!

So many places use \u201ctapas\u201d as a pretext to fleece you and leave you going home hungry. Weak pours on  18 dollar glasses of wine. Hilariously tiny portion sizes.

But no dishes was a standout and they all lacked a \"\"wow\"\" factor that you'd expect from a one-starred Michelin place.

They gave us a call to let us know our table was ready only minutes after we put our name down for a 1hr 15min wait. I missed the phone call but they did not send a text, provide any way to contact them back in order to be seated, or give a small window of time for me to come back to the restaurant. When our table was ready they texted me but I was still made to wait 20 min for a table outside upon my arrival back to the restaurant even when there were many seats open at the bar. A flawed system in my opinion so I highly recommend getting a reservation if you can.\nExcellent, interesting dishes and fantastic wine. Great service.\n\"Everything was so good w/ the nori fritters and sweet corn agnolotti being standout memorable.

It was the right amount of spiciness.\n\nWe enjoyed the bluefin tuna. I mean, it\u2019s quite hard to go wrong with carpaccio style dishes especially when made with high quality ingredients. The dish could have been a lot better if there were some plain bread on the side to soak up all the umaminess. (I did see a server bring out some bread for another table towards the end of our meal but we didn\u2019t see it in the menu nor did our server propose it as an option)\n\nThe butterflied trout was the standout dish.

We were hoping for more refined and interesting options since it\u2019s a Michelin starred restaurant. The basque cheesecake was good, comparable to the ones we had at San Sebestian.

An unforgettable meal with a lot of love and passion in each dish.\n\"I\u2019ve been here twice for lunch and each time I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed. The food, wine, service, and staff are all exceptional. The menu seems to change except for a few legacy items like the ham and cheese sandwich (each time, I\u2019ve passed on ordering this, saw it come out for a different table, and muttered to myself that I need to get it next time. next time I will!).

You don\u2019t need to order 6-7 dishes to be satisfied. And I can\u2019t forget the wine. Great selection and a knowledgeable staff to help you find a specific flavor profile or pair a glass with a dish.\n\nHighly recommend!\"\n\"Wonderful experience.\nNot only was the food perfect and utterly delicious, the service was some of the best I\u2019ve had in NYC in 13 years living here. The service was on par with a 2 star Michelin spot, and the food! Yet the prices for these perfect dishes were totally reasonable.\nThe menu was structured in the perfect high/low fashion - $8 for some of the best bread (large portion) I\u2019ve ever had, $18 for one of the best salads, or mid-$30s/$40s for incredible meat mains with good portion size.\n\nWhen you take these gorgeous dishes that are perfectly executed and so delicious, and factor in that the service was some of the most thoughtful I\u2019ve ever experienced, this place makes you feel like every penny is worth it.\n\nIn a city where there\u2019s a million options, this is one I will definitely be returning to.\"\nI\u2019ve been wanting to go here forever because I heard about how amazing it was but never had the chance till last night.  We walked in at 5:30pm and took the last two seats the bar. Wow what a place. From the lighting, music and general vibe it\u2019s all really just a 10 for me. The service, wine list and food were amazing. There is so much value in a dining experience like that and the price definitely reflects jt.  I cannot wait to go back!\nStaff, service, food, wine, atmosphere... everything was exceptional!\nWow, so glad I came here. I had the clams and scallops - both amazing, both made by Dylan Takao, one of the chefs there. If you go and he's working definitely order what he's making because there's some real talent there. The dessert was incredible as well, I highly recommend the vanilla gelato with dulce de leches foam\n\"Excellent food and wine. The restaurant is beautifully done and extremely well executed. I highly recommend every food and wine lover try this place.\n\nIf the price was a bit lower and it was easier to get a table I\u2019d be a regular.\"\nClassic, yet flavorful food w/ great service, natural wines & good vibes; can\u2019t be beat\n\"We walked in because we were waiting for L\u2019industrie to open. We were just going to have some wine at the bar but the couple across from us unintentionally gave us the show of our lives and inspired us to eat\u2026\n\nTry the Ham & Cheese sandwich\u2026 I\u2019m not even going to say anything else.

From start to finish not a beat missed and quite possibly my favorite NYC restaurant right now.\nOne of the best meals I\u2019ve had in recent months, I\u2019d give this place six stars if I could. Not an easy restaurant to get into but once you do, you\u2019re in for an incredible meal! Great space and friendly service. In terms of dishes there wasn\u2019t a single miss. Standouts included a grilled squid, Manila clams with some amazing bread to soak up the sauce, and an excellent fried chicken. I really love the chef\u2019s use of spice with a few dishes having a nice little kick to wake up the taste buds. They also have an excellent wine list with some interesting offerings. I can\u2019t wait to return!\nThe best meal we had our whole trip. It\u2019s not cheap, but everything was so delicious and the service was fantastic. I love asking for recommendations and had lots of questions about American wines (we drank a Texan Chardonnay) and the staff at the four horseman were super knowledgeable and helpful.\nGreat food, excellent atmosphere worm service\nAbsolutely amazing meal!! I ate at The Four Horsemen for lunch in March 2022. The food was absolutely divine! We began with the Spanish Mackerel which was perfectly cooked, bright, and savory; we then ate the grilled octopus skewers which came with an amazing green sauce! We finished our savory meal with the pappardelle lamb ragu, which was comforting and had some of the most well cooked, delicious noodles. We then ordered some bread (and dipped it in the sauces, of course!) However, the highlight of the meal was easily the dessert: the sticky toffee pudding!! Our waiter told us that it is, \"what dreams are made of,\" and he was absolutely correct! It was gooey, sweet, and delicious (with the perfect texture and warmth); probably the best dessert I have ever had (and I love dessert!). The service was also phenomenal, and staff were so kind! The Four Horseman is a must if you are in Brooklyn for AMAZING food!\nDelish. Early walk-in. Ate at the bar, would return. Great wine selection, and deserts.\nA+ for the food and drinks. This restaurant has lovely vibes and a very delicious small menu.\nSuper kind staff. Phenomenal list all price range. Killer food.\nDelicious food, great service.\nGreat vibe and great wine. Shoutout to Sam behind the bar killing it. Only wish is that they were open later thought-out the week and the weekend. Make sure you get a reservation\nGreat selection of wine and AMAZING food!!! We tried half the menu and everything was beyond delicious. Standouts were the mussels, swordfish, and you must get the coffee gelato dessert!!! You just have to. New favorite spot for sure.\nFour Horsemen was a phenomenal experience. I booked a reservation 4 weeks in advance for a special occasion, and the host greeted us and wished us well on our event.

I'm not very skilled with wine pairing, so I had plenty of questions for our waitress. She was a great listener and was very helpful in her answers based on what i was looking for. Each course was easy to share, well composed, and packed with flavor. My favorite was the yuzu yellowfin tuna. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with our experience and would gladly come back. We were seated for approximately 90 minutes without any hurry to finish and leave.\nExcessively mediocre and uninteresting. There is nothing here you will remember eating a week from now.\n\"Everything was good here!\n\nWe got here a little before dinner service, and at 5pm on the dot, the server brought us dinner menus. We ordered the bread, chicories, braised leek toast, yellowfin tuna, and swordfish.\n\nThe bread was pillowy soft, with a toasty crust, less sourdough-tough and more crispy. The chicories were doused with an anchovy-heavy dressing, which was so savory. The braised leek toast was similarly savory, and very tender. The tuna was almost as soft as pudding, and the tonnato and yuzu kosho complimented it perfectly. The swordfish was also impeccably tender, which can be difficult to pull off for a muscular fish, but apparently not too hard for the chefs here.\n\nFor dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was a good level of sweet, offset by the creme fraiche and rounded out with a salted caramel sauce. The gelato was stunningly smooth and the coffee zabaglione was airy and rich.\n\nI hope to come back and try everything else on the menu!\"", "doc_id": "c2fb0537-0dfa-4903-9df3-78bda5a939e0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0572303244255a76e085ab824c82a302b6f2b1cdc524bce9f3983db1e5e9ec76", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 29441, "end": 31671}, "relationships": {"1": "1dbdfccb-8e17-4d7d-ac7f-0e4f7e83d6d7", "2": "7bc499c9-4ce3-42d3-9508-01e836a3888e"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
