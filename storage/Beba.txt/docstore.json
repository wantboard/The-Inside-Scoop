The owner is a person who has a nose for high quality produce and service. From the cloth towels and high quality soap in the bathroom to the ambiance in the restaurant, everything is ergonomically and aesthetically thought out. Despite being a small space, 30 places are well aired out and I never felt cramped. The volume management is great, with music, other diners and ambiant sound never feeling obtrusive. The ingredients on the menu are thoughtfully chosen, and are prepared with great skill. The server to client ratio is such that your water or wine glass is always tended to, and kitchen staff prepare food that is served as soon as it is plated. Kitchen and waiting staff are super friendly, respectful, and attentive. A high quality bunch of folks that deliver high quality cuisine.  Very much recommended for a slow, immersive evening of refined and relaxed dining.  Special thanks to Antoine for taking care of us and making it a memorable evening out with my best friend.\nFantastic cosy place. Great food, drinks and vibe.

Absolutely not. Very inconsistent. Cocktail really not good, just tasted watery, bad choice on my part. Empanada and crudo was amazing. The strozapetti was ok with $21 extra white truffles which was dry and didn't taste truffle at all which is disappointing. Black bass was good, however with edges, it's ok it happens. The Brussels sprouts were completely inedible, one of the worst dishes I've seen, visually and in the mouth, it was way too spicy.\n\nThe service ... I work in catering and I eat at the restaurant at least once a week, it was also disappointing. The waitress was a little off, I'm not attacking her, I don't know her and I don't know what was going on that night for her. His menu pitch was way too long and irrelevant, not to mention important info like Brussels sprouts are spicy. She pushed her sales too much too, recommending 6 dishes for 2 is a lot. Sighing when someone doesn't take a digestive is no.

A true gem for the city.\nVery attentive, guest-focused and well-paced service.

I'm not really a mushroom guy but the beef and mushroom empanadas single handedly changed my opinion on mushrooms. Very cozy and overall just a great time.\nMackerel and empanada are good. Would not recommend the rabbit. The lady who serviced us isn\u2019t friendly.\n\"It breaks my heart to say it, because we have been planning to come for so long, but it was mid...\n1) The atmosphere was wonderful and very comfortable, but because the menu is very small there are limited options for those with dietary needs.\n2) The dishes were very creative, but very expensive! For over 50$ main plates we didn't feel that the dish was outstanding. For example, I ordered the black bass and lima beans. The lima beans were a bit cold, and the black bass was good, but a smaller piece than I was expecting for the price. Probably the bone marrow and saffron pushed up the price, but I don't know how much they added to the dish. The rabbit and clams were good, clams a bit chewy, but the sauce was amazing. I really wished it came with bread to complete the meal.\n3) The brussel sprouts were a bit salty and very close to the edge of burnt. Honestly they were gaslightning me. I couldn't tell if they were an artistic choice and I just don't have a fancy enough taste to appreciate them, or simply a bit overcooked and oversalted. And in the end, a restaurant that makes me feel that way is not one I would return to, or recommend.\nEmpanadas were very good.\"\nUnreal evening at Restaurant Beba last night. The server / bartender, Antoine, took great care of us and the space is a comfortable and stylish spot on a quiet street in Verdun.

The waitress called the other restaurant but could not get through so she left a voice-mail. Instead of sending the man on his way (the restaurant was packed and did not have any tables open) the waitress made room for the man even though they had a full house.

Normally I\u2019m not a sweets person but the flan and the semifreddo were both perfect endings to the meal.\"\n\"The highlights for me were the (off-menu) sweetbreads special and the empanada. The guineafowl was pretty good but nothing that crazy, and the capellini, while also tasty, was pretty oily and small for the amount you get. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the semifreddo.\n\nOverall, the food is definitely unique and high quality here, but I think it\u2019s a bit overpriced. Nice that it\u2019s near the metro though!\"\nThis is just an excellent restaurant all around. Been there twice and loved it even more the second time. All was excellent, but the semifreddo dessert was out of this world.\nAbsolutely delicious, amazing flavour for each dishes. The lamb was surprisingly delicious for someone who doesn\u2019t like lamb would still enjoy it they change their menu very often so you will never get bored of it :)\nAlways the best!!!!\n\"What a beautiful and cozy place.\nThe service was impeccable. The food was super tasty! And the pricing very reasonable.\nWe highly recommend.\"\nTheir menu is amazing! Super rich in flavors, delicious! The empanadas are to die for. I have tried so many empanadas in my life and I can say that these ones have been probably the best ones I have tried! We ordered the whole menu for a party of 3. It was a lot BUT we really wanted to try everything. I'll definitely come back very soon!\nAmazing food, beautiful plating and fantastic service. No complaints from me\nWow! Absolutely amazing food and service! The flavors, presentation, pairings were all so well thought out and a great ambiance and crowd too\nAbsolutely loved the experience: amazing sofisticated dishes, attentive service. Great wine choice. You can see chefs whipping up their magic right in front of you. Not just a meal - an experience. They should upgrade their sound system though!\nAmazing food. Memorable meal.

We paid $40 per person for the reservation for 4 people and explained that Google listing had them as Argentine restaurant so after looking at their menu which was very confusing and no steak we wanted to know if they would return the deposit as we wanted what we saw in their on line photos. \"No ,you can stay and have fun or you can leave\" !!!!

Menu changes regularly so no point mentioning what we had, except if there\u2019s a semifreddo on offer for dessert you should definitely order it. Overall I was impressed with the balanced complexity of flavours, how everything was cooked perfectly, and the generous servings of sauces and toppings such as pine nuts and pistachios, which is quite uncommon.\n\nBy Vancouver standards, this was extremely good value too. We stuffed ourselves and had three drinks in total and the bill was under $150.\n\nThe entire restaurant is quite small and was already uncomfortably loud at half capacity. For a quieter experience, choose the patio which has nice shading and a view of a park with playground.\"\nOne of the best restaurant experiences. We had the empanadas and involtini as appetizers. Beef tongue as a small plate. Finally the ribeye as the large plate. We shared everything between 2 people. Food was absolutely incredible. Hands down the best steak and overall menu I've had. Everything worked really well together, including the house cocktails. Excellent service by Shelley. Cannot recommend enough.\nAmazing restaurant.
