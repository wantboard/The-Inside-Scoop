Their sundae (for 2) is definitely big enough to serve more than 2 people, be warned \u25e1\u0308 Great restaurant and will definitely visit again when we return to nyc.\n\"Very rarely like to start off with the bad but here we go. Scallop crudo. $32. One single scallop swimming in what reminded me of wheatgrass juice. Not a lick of seasoning. It was shocking. Made me wonder if the chefs are tasting the food and I felt like a clown for ordering it. Crudos should be zingy, luscious, and bright. This made me feel like I was being put on a green juice cleanse (against my will).\n\nNow onto the good. Sat at the bar and the bar staff was fantastic. The granny smith appletini is one of the best cocktails I\u2019ve had in a while and the souffl\u00e9 cakes were craveable. I wanted 10 of both.\n\nWould come back to sit for dinner and try the duck but the crudo definitely put a big dent in my faith in Francie as a restaurant and I hope they rework the dish.\"\n\"Spent my graduation dinner here. The family style plating here makes it one of the most cozy and suitable place for all kinds of celebrations.\n\nAlso have to mention that the staff here are super friendly and helpful.\"\nWe had a celebration dinner for around 20 in the back room at Francie and I could not recommend Francie more highly for mid- large-sized functions. Most restaurants seriously compromise on food or service for large parties and Francie was the opposite. The large roast duck and steak were fabulous entrees showing consideration of the format as opposed to just using the usual menu. Each app and starter was better than the last. I highly recommend Frenchie for your next celebration, function, party, or work event.\nSuperb food service and ambiance\n\"(Translated by Google) Amazing landscape and architecture\n\n(Original)\n\u00da\u017easn\u00e1 krajina i architektura\"\nGood yummy food, not mind-blowing but super solid\nFoie gras, seared - was very delicious and I really recommend it.\nExcellent food & service. The chocolate desert is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had.\nThis establishment is perfection thoroughly. From the moment you enter the doors you are greeted  warmly.  The cheese cart diverse and exceptional. The parpadelle and conchglie you will sacrifice one of your children.  We drive 6 hours every 3 months just to eat here.  Every bite is a party in your mouth.  Oh the cocktails better than your wedding night.\n\"I highly recommend the soufflee cake (the combination of caviar and soufflee is so creative and surprisingly good). For dessert, you can try the pavlova passion fruit (not too sweet). For the pasta, you can order the pappardelle (a little too salty for me but I like the smell the pasta texture). Other things we tried are just so so.\nIt\u2019s a great place to bring your date for a dinner -it can\u2019t go wrong.\nFor foodies like me, it might not be special enough to attract me to come here another time.\"\n\"A very nice dinner with exceptional service\nA menu that delighted\nAnd staff wearing their music heros\nT-shirts\nFrom T-Rex to Eric Dolphy\nHighly recommend\"\nAmazing restaurant in Brooklyn with professional service and absolutely stunning food, an experience that feels like a hug from an old friend: warm and welcoming.

The dry-aged roast duck is a MUST eat and the entire tasting experience is fun and interactive. The servers usually bring the whole duck (with flower arrangements on the side) to the table for you to take photos before cutting them into slices. The portion is huge so if you\u2019re also ordering individual entrees and appetizers, I\u2019d suggest to share the duck with 4-6 ppl.\n\nIn addition to the duck, I also highly recommend the fois gras, clam pasta, sourdough bread + piggy butter and truffle ice cream.

Fortunately, our server was kind enough to redirect our plans when he (correctly) recognized we weren't ordering enough food to share. Much to my enjoyment, we also had a couple instances where our server or another staff member classically folded our napkin each time we left the table to use the restroom -- points for Francie.\n\nThe food hit the mark across the board...however, the most memorable bite of all was the pork lardo with sourdough. This was absolutely underrated and so good that we ordered two of this dish. So simple, yet so tasty.\n\nAll in all, Francie was excellent and worth the hype!\"\nGreat food and upscale service. The menu is short but it packs a real punch. Perfect pappardelle bolognese, creamy and meaty. The fish was cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly, the food took a while to come out though.\n\"Out of all the food we got, we really liked the sweet corn savory bombolini, it had summer truffle on top and it was super delicious and full of flavor. The clams pasta was a bit sour but also super interesting.\n\nService was really good here, waiters and waitresses were super attentive.

When we came in the hostest said she had been trying to reach us all day to reconfirm our reservation and that it might take a while to be seated because of this. We were a bit thrown off hearing this ;as we had put a credit card on the reservation which in our experience means you are 100% confirmed) to which the hostess replied it doesn\u2019t work this way and we cannot assume a reservation is confirmed just with the credit card, we have to also reconfirm via phone. This didn\u2019t make any sense to us because we would have been charged a no show fee of 35 per person if we had not arrived, yet our table was given away because we didnt call 24 hours before to reconfirm.\nIn addition the food took a long long time to arrive. Even though our waitress and the rest of the staff were very nice the experience in general was far from a michelin star (service wise).\"\nFrancie was a divine experience in both culinary and service.  Our party of 9 was treated to an awesome time . We will definitely be back.\nI dine out a lot, so probably make about 100 reservations between Resy and Opentable every year.  It is hard to make plans and just walk into many of the better restaurants in New York without a reservation.  Sometimes plans just change or need to change last minute.  This is the ONLY place that has actually charged me a cancellation fee.  I have spent over $200 at this restaurant for cancellations (not no shows) and have never eaten a bite of food, so I have no idea how good it is, but please be cautious if you think you may have to alter plans because they will charge full freight.  I also did not turn around and charge the friends who could not make it, as that did not seem right\u2026.\n\"(Translated by Google) Easy and committed to the success of our evening\n\n(Original)\nFacile et engag\u00e9 dans le succ\u00e8s de notre soir\u00e9e\"\nThe sticky toffee pudding is a must.

We also got the sticky pudding dessert which was great. I recommend the whiskey smash for a cocktail.\nDuck duck duck. I went here with my fathers friend whom I haven\u2019t seen in 10+ years and we order the duck pappardelle, and the rohan duck. It really was a pleasure to eat here.

The souffl\u00e9 pancakes and conchiglie were two of the best!!\nPredominantly, it was a marvelous experience albeit, it was a tad pricey. The staff was super friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Our water glasses were never left empty.\nIt was complete perfection. The staff and the food were both some of the best I\u2019ve experienced. Every single thing was amazing and I\u2019m so happy we went. Pasta: perfection steak: perfection. It doesn\u2019t get much better than this.\nAwesome place. Food and service are exceptional. Duck is must try. As well as asparagus first course dish. I also liked pana cotta. Service was very attentive. Especially to guests food allergies. Very nice decor makes the experience complete and satisfying.\nDrinks, food, and service are quite good.\nLove the roast duck!!!\n\"Such a fantastic evening! Erica was an incredible hostess who made sure our evening was able to proceed smoothly despite having some trouble getting to our reservation with weather and traffic.\n\nWe celebrated here for a birthday and every detail from our waitress to the level of noise, music, space and atmosphere was perfect.\n\nThe duck is phenomenal and we loved that the presentation comes out first before they carve and prepare it all for you!\n\nThe souffl\u00e9s with caviar and oysters were also a perfect starter as we waited for the duck to arrive.\n\nTo top it all off, the earl gray dessert was one of the best desserts I have ever had.\n\nOur palates are completely satisfied having experienced this delectable culinary walking tour.\"\n\"This is a beautiful restaurant with experienced, attentive staff. It was wonderful to sit by the kitchen and watch the \"\"ballet\"\" of the team carefully preparing the food.\n\nMy favorite dishes were the duck mortadella, the pastas, and the pithivier. We didn't order the show dishes of the duck and the steak. We felt they were too pricey for what you wound up with, but we did order the fries which were great. Francie was very nice, but the food wasn't dreamy as in it hasn't haunted me and taunted me. I didn't really remember what we had -- thank God for the photos.

(We think it was the somelier who took some of our orders while introducing us to some wine). We ordered souffle cakes, carrot dish, and the dry aged crown of duck. The souffle was soft, warm, flavor wise tasted like a quiche, texture was a cross between cornbread (without the corn meal and fluffy eggs). Interesting flavor profile arises when spreading the caviar butter onto the souffle, let's just keep it at that. The carrots was the best dish we ordered that night, freshly picked, can taste the earthiness. Then comes the crown of duck. It looks good for Instagram, they even show you the hole duck prior to butchering it for the gram. The dry aged duck flavor wise tasted rich, gamey and an aftertaste of a bloody hunt. The texture of the skin was crunchy on the surface... unfortunately that's all the positives I can highlight. The fat doesn't melt in your mouth, it was rather chewy, the meat was more difficult to chew. Comparing French style duck breast I've had, Francie's duck meat was on the chewy side. Maybe I had a bad batch of duck, maybe I'm bias towards softer/less chewy meats. Overall, I'd give Francie another try after sampling all the Michelin restaurants in NY.\n\"Came here for my first fine dining experience - fairly expensive, but such a great atmosphere and experience.\nBroke my heart a little bit paying $10 for a can of NA athletic brewing beer, but the food was to die for.\"\n\"Fantastic diner\nNice service\nFood quality top notch \ud83d\udc4c\nIt was great getting the chance go diner there.

My boyfriend and I arrived right on time but was told the table is not ready due to delay of customers before us. Then I asked how long the wait will be and if we can get a drink at the bar while waiting. The girl said no the bar is too busy. And her manager came over and said she doesn't know how long we will need to wait and then just left without any explanation or apology. Later on, a third lady showed up at the front desk and said maybe 15 min. During the whole process, no one tried to comfort us or help us settle down. We were annoyed and decided to go elsewhere. I asked the front desk if we can just cancel the reservation and if I would get charged. She confirmed I won't be charged. But later on, I found I was charged 70 dollar no show fee. I called the restaurant and was directed to a manager who I did not see or interacted with when I was there. He refused to refund me and his excuse was that none of the people I talked to at the front desk was manager. So they made a mistake but none of their words count so I still got charged. What a joke! How is a customer supposed to know who is the boss there?? Am I supposed to record my conversation with the front desk? And during the call, I did not get one single apology.

Nothing special. 1/3 of our duck is undercooked so it became very chewy. The top 1/3 of the breast has crunchy skin. Side dishes are salty. Again, you won't miss anything you don't order it.
