Glorious views of Manhattan across the way. Intelligently and masterfully curated prix fixe (fixed price) menus that include a platter of salatim, a sumptuous skewer/shishlik of your choice, and dessert. The salatim is an assortment of ten small dishes, served with pita on the side. Attentive and knowledgeable staff. Chef Mike Mayo on the floor getting stuck in too.\nGreat experience. Amazing salatim and entrees\nThe view is worth the hype. Salatim were mainly on the spicy side, and most had cilantro in them (relevant to cilantro haters like me). Salatim and pita are all refillable. The hummus was very salty, too salty, but otherwise good. I had the steak skewer which was excellent flavor wise but a bit chewy. Would order again. Spouse had the lamb kofta which was very juicy and delicious. The fries, which we ordered as an extra, were the star. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the accompanying sauce was great. We drank Arak the Boat which was not strong and very sweet. Soft serve dessert had strong sesame flavor with the tahini and a nice interplay of textures and salty/sweet/sour from the cherries. Overall, a very filling meal, excellent service, and a beautiful view (bring sunglasses at sunset).\nThe place was greet presented  fabulous of New York City . The portions of food were quite large . The service was quite good and the bill was what I expected to receive no surprises .\nGreat Israeli food with amazing views. Is it worth $250 for two with wine? Depends on what you can afford, but as a treat, we loved it. We ordered a chicken and a beef shishlik with a bottle of Bonny Doon orange wine, followed by a final cocktail. It was too much food for two people but they make it easy to package leftovers. Our server was great, the views are incredible (but the bar faces the kitchen), the meat perfectly cooked. The problem is we were rudely told to get going by a host while finishing our last drink. We dropped what I think was a good amount of money, sat inconspicuously at the bar and probably were 5-10 minutes from leaving. I've never been told to get a move on it before, it was so rude I doubt I'll return. There are plenty of other places in NYC to spend $$$ that are also hospitable. I wrote the restaurant but no response. Too bad, a rude host marred an otherwise wonderful night. Caveat emptor, but also, l'chaim!\nHad an incredible experience here, the food somehow manages to outshine the incredible view. This is now the place I\u2019ll be recommending to people wanting a memorable meal. We got the steak skewer and the beef and lamb koobideh and both had fantastic flavor and texture. This meal made a Monday night in May feel like New Year\u2019s Day. Big fan.\nExcellent!! Completely worth the hype.\nSlow on the dips\nBy far one of the best meals I ever had, very accommodating to vegans as well\nI have been to the Brooklyn and Phili Laser Wolf and they both aim to please. I love the salatim and the salmon.\nAbsolutely fantastic, one of the best meals of my life. So many moments during this dinner completely blew me away. I can't describe the spread you have to just go try it for yourself. Service was excellent as well.\nHave been to Zahav in Philly and was hoping this would be good. Its one of the best restaurants in NY. Not too expensive or pretentious. Great view and vibe. Excellent food and service.\nHad the most wonderful meal at Laser Wolf. The food is incredible.

My only complaint (but still doing 5 stars) is the poor wine choices. Being an Israeli themed restaurant I don't understand why they only have one very commercial Israeli wine.  Their are so many great choices like Pelter, Assaf and others, I just don't get why they won't carry them,.  Other than that, can't wait to go back.\ngreat meal\n\"It's worth the wait!

Would highly recommend to anyone whether you're going on a date, going to celebrate, or just going with family too. Pricing was reasonable, quantity and quality was great. Customer service was amazing and the environment was just so calming and a perfect dinner spot. It would be great for lunch too!

This Israeli shipudiya, or skewer house, is a feast for the senses.\n\nThe journey begins with their signature hummus and pita, which is simply divine. But it's the array of colorful vegetable salatim that really sets the stage for the meal to come. Each bite is bursting with flavor and freshness, making you feel like you've been transported to a Middle Eastern market.\n\nAnd then comes the main event: the meat and vegetable skewers cooked on the charcoal grill. Each skewer is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, with juicy meats and perfectly charred vegetables that are simply delicious. But what really sets Laser Wolf apart is the variety of skewers they offer, from lamb to chicken to beef to vegetarian options, there's something for everyone.\n\nBut Laser Wolf is more than just great food, it's also a unique and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. The rooftop setting provides stunning views of the Brooklyn skyline, and the laid-back vibe is perfect for a relaxed evening out with friends or a romantic date night.\"\n\"I had been eyeing Laser Wolf for a while, and finally got the chance to experience it. Knowing I would be in Brooklyn for work, I secured a reservation at the restaurant, which is located on the rooftop of the Hoxton hotel. As someone who had never tried Israeli cuisine before, I was eagerly anticipating this meal.\n\nAlthough I ran a bit late due to my underestimation of the complexity of the New York City subway system, the restaurant was accommodating and I arrived only a couple of minutes past my reservation time. Upon arriving, I was struck by the stunning panoramic view of the East River and Manhattan from the rooftop location.\n\nAfter settling in and studying the menu, I opted for the steak shishlik from the grill menu, which is a pre-fixe meal that includes all the salatim and dessert. Salatim, or side dishes/salads, are a common accompaniment in Israeli cuisine, and I was excited to try them. I also ordered the Date-Harissa Wings with Tehina Ranch, as I have a weakness for wings.\n\nShortly after ordering, the  platter arrived with 11 delicious items, including babaganoush, hummus, mushroom, and lutenitsa. The soft and fluffy pita bread was perfect for enjoying the side dishes. The wings soon followed and they were cooked to perfection, with a perfectly sweet and tangy coating that paired perfectly with the tehina ranch. I had a great time trying all the different salatim and even experimented with mixing and matching them to create even more complex flavors.\n\nThe fragrant rice and steak shishlik arrived shortly after, and I was overjoyed with the flavors and aromas of this meal.

We have already booked our next reservation to come back with a larger group.\nReally hard to get a table but worth setting the calendar reminder! All the sides are delicious (and included) and sitting at the counter watching the charcoal grill is very fun.\nLet me start of by mentioning that Laser Wolf has been on my hitlist for 4 months. So to say I came with high expectations is an understatement\u2026 & boy did it deliver! If you\u2019re able to, I recommend coming for that 5-545 seating so you can watch the sunset in      this spectacular space. The salatim was delicious & the pita was always served fresh, the added bonus of these being  refillable was enough to get me to come back. My friend chose the chicken while I went for the shawarma spiced cauliflower, per our server Jacob\u2019s rec.  They were both filled with so much flavor & cooked to perfection, I\u2019m pretty sure silence filled our table as we ate\u2014 just too good! Highly recommend Laser Wolf. Already planning my next dinner back!\n\"Laser Wolf was one of the hardest reservations we were able to get for our trip to NYC last winter, but it was totally worth it! The restaurant is located on the roof of a hotel in Williamsburg, which gave us an amazing view of the NYC skyline at night and a dim, vibrant ambiance for our meal.\n\nOur meal started with Salatim, a platter of assorted appetizers and side dishes. The variety of different veggies and seasonings in each appetizer was extremely pleasant and we enjoyed trying every one!\n\nAs mains, we ordered the Shawarma-Spiced Cauliflower as well as the Chicken Shishlik\u2014Surprisingly, we liked the cauliflower even more than the chicken. I was blown away by how much flavor could be incorporated into a dish whose main emphasis was cauliflower, and would definitely order it again.\n\nFinally, our meal wrapped up with a brown sugar soft serve that was well put-together and not too sweet. Overall, we would highly recommend trying at least once to fight for a reservation at Laser Wolf!\"\nGreat atmosphere, phenomenal steak shish,\nVery good food, great portions, awesome vibes. 9/10\n\"Saw Laser Wolf on a Netflix show but it was the Philly one and was so excited to learn there was one in NY!

This place has complimentary and unlimited \"\"salatim\"\" which are small side dishes such as hummus, pickles, beans, etc. which we devoured on our appetizer plates. However, those plates were never cleared and we were never offered new clean plates for our main entree. For a restaurant of this caliber I would expect someone to at least come to switch out the plates for when the main course comes, especially if we are sharing everything (salatim and we ordered the Branzino for 2)\nFood: 4 stars\n- Salatim - delicious! I loved the warm pita and hummus. Other standouts were the celery root and gigante beans. Tip: you can totally ask for more and then take home what you can't finish!\n- Branzino for two - beautiful presentation, deboned (head on) and stuffed with ginger and tomato puree - this was delicious - first few bites were sweet, tangy, smoky and rich. However, after taking a few more bites the flavors started to get overwhelmingly salty. It also came with an herbed rice -- which was good but nothing special\n- Brown sugar ice cream - this was delicious, I loved it because of the sesame seeds - I am a sucker for black sesame in anything!\n\nI would return for sure and maybe try another entree that isn't so salty. I went home and drank 2 bottles of water!\"\nI dined here with my son who just moved to Brooklyn. It was very hard to get a reservation. The hosts and servers were welcoming and friendly. The cocktails were memorable. We LOVED the salatim. The brisket and lamb were well seasoned and tender. The softserve was an unexpected treat. Great concept. Wish they had more seating and seating for larger groups. The icing on the cake was the view of Manhattan.\nEveryone should experience the view is amazing. If possible request Tabitha as server she was the best.\nCame here for a special date night, would recommend coming with a party of 4 or larger. All of the dishes we had were phenomenal, I literally rolled out of there I ate so much!\n\"Worth the hype.\n\nNot THAT expensive as far as fine dining/hot spots go. I've been to Zahav in Philly and this definitely brought me back. The Salatim was insanely good. Smoothest, most well seasoned Hummus imaginable. Fresh pita.

I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but we blown away but all the flavor from each dish. No misses.\n\nWas really fun to combine salatim in a pita. SO many combinations\n\nThe chicken shish was easily the biggest sleeper on the menu. I mean, HOW good could chicken on a skewer taste? Uhhhhh certainly not like the Chick Shishtik at LW.

It's not cheap, but if you have the means or want to go for a special occasion. Totally worth it\"\n\"Really awesome!

Much appreciated and the sesame coating very tasty!\"\nIt was fine, hole in the wall places have better hummus. Seems to prioritize vibes over food. They seemed shocked when I asked for extra pita. Portions are solid.\nPretty sure I saw Pete Davidson\u2019s next girlfriend here tonight.\nTerrific place to bring company in the city. The food is wonderful and great for communal nothing. Their cocktails are interesting and thoughtful while all remaining crowd pleasers. The view of Manhattan is gorgeous and sure to impress anyone visiting. Can't recommend enough for company or maybe just a cute date night.\n\"Calling all food snobs! I double dare you.  I schlepped all the way from Jersey in torrential rain to taste the menu, and surprisingly have to say I was thoroughly impressed.   A friend recommended the venue since my family is middle eastern, and I've been dying to try it.  Wonderful scenery, fun vibe, but let's talk food.  The mezzas  (appetizers) were on point and the fresh pita, warm and fluffy . The flavors, spices, and quality of meats were superior than the fanciest restaurants in Manhattan. I didn't take enough photos but definitely order the chicken wings, it melts in your mouth.  The lamb was exquisite, the beef was well marinaded and tender, and the Branzino for two is pictured below.  Service= 5 stars.  Smiles all around and well worth the trip. Bravo!\n\nP.S. If you ever decide to become a franchise and/or open a restaurant in Bergen County, let me know.  I can find you a perfect location across the River.

Special shout-out to Eden who was an absolute gem! Also thanking Brandan and Joan (sorry if I misspelled). Great birthday for me!\nSolid meal but I\u2019m having a hard time saying it was worth it. Some of the positives- nice space/ambience, river + skyline views, salatim dishes were flavorful, soft serve was rich, fries and wings had a nice crispy texture. That being said, super disappointed in the main meat dishes, the portions were very small, the brisket was quite dry and lacked flavor. For essentially an assortment of cabbage/olives/pickles/beans/dips and bar/street food, the price felt very disproportionate to the quality- ended up being $160 for 2 people, and that\u2019s without drinks. Aside from the brisket nothing is bad but I\u2019ve had the equivalent elsewhere, so I fear you\u2019re paying more for the location and the name than the actual food. I would say skip it and spend your money elsewhere.\nThis place is deserves all the hype it's getting.\n\"(Translated by Google) Israeli cuisine overlooking Manhattan. The food is delicious and the view and atmosphere are great. The menu is only a prefix course, and if you choose the main course, it comes with an appetizer, salatim (about 10 small plates), hummus, pita bread, rice, and dessert. The recommended steak skewer I ordered for the main was juicy and soft and very delicious. Since it is a rooftop, it is covered with measures against the cold in winter, but it seems to be open and comfortable in summer.\n\n(Original)\n\u30de\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u4e00\u671b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30a4\u30b9\u30e9\u30a8\u30eb\u6599\u7406\u3002\u6599\u7406\u306f\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304f\u3001\u666f\u8272\u3068\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u304c\u6700\u9ad8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u306f\u30d7\u30ea\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u307f\u3067\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u9078\u3076\u3068\u3001\u524d\u83dc\u306b\u30b5\u30e9\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0\uff08\u5c0f\u76bf10\u7a2e\u304f\u3089\u3044\uff09\u3001\u30d5\u30e0\u30b9\u3001\u30d4\u30bf\u30d1\u30f3\u3001\u3054\u98ef\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u983c\u3093\u3060\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u4e32\u304c\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3067\u3068\u3066\u3082\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30eb\u30fc\u30d5\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u51ac\u306f\u5bd2\u3055\u5bfe\u7b56\u3067\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u590f\u306f\u89e3\u653e\u7684\u3067\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3088\u3055\u305d\u3046\u3002\"\nLove the atmosphere, views etc. The food was good but as good as some other Israeli restaurants.

The two of us got the Steak Shishlik and the Grilled Eggplant, both of which were phenomenal. Lastly, it has one of the best views of the Manhattan skyline. Absolutely incredible dining experience.\nTruly amazing. We\u2019ve been to Zahav and K\u2019Far in Philly, which is the same chef. All of the places are great, but Laser Wolf has definitely been our favorite. The starters are ALL so good - hummus, pita, pickles, and more. The meat entrees - we got chicken and brisket - were juicy and soo flavorful. The wait staff is truly AMAZING. They were all so friendly and helpful. We will most definitely be back soon. We went for date night, but I think our next time will be with a bigger group so we can try all the different entrees. Not pictured, but do not sleep on the fries (I know I know, but really). It comes with a tahini dipping that is unreal. Finally, the dessert is unique, playful, and satisfying palate cleanser.\nDon't be fooled by Solomonov's \"Israeliness\" - he left Israel at age 3. His \"Israeli\" food is nothing more than an American chef's interpretation. Real Israelis won't be found at his Philly and NYC restaurants. He sells a falsely constructed \"Israeli\" ambiance and charges exorbitant prices for dishes like cauliflower that would be complimentary in Israel. Beware of cultural appropriation and overpriced gimmicks\nMy favorite place in all of Brooklyn, and not just because of the vivacious rooftop view. The customer service is the GREATEST I have ever experienced. The ambiance is - dare I say; perfect , for a date night. I had the pleasure of taking my girlfriend here for  our 2 year anniversary. And we were treated phenomenally, as we made our way to the restaurant everyone that we had encountered wished us a \"Happy Anniversary!\" Our waiter Ritchie went above and beyond for us - he ensured he did all in his ability to make our night special. It was nothing short of wondrous from the food, to the elaborate drinks, and a very knowledgeable and friendly staff this place checked all my boxes for a good time! All else I can say is make sure you COME HUNGRY, the menu is fantastic!\nThe view is great. Food was just ok, probably wouldn\u2019t come back. The appetizer with multiple dips was super average. The same goes for the mains, we had brisket, lamb and trout.

Thanks for honoring Israeli food Michael, you make us look (and taste) realllly good!\nIt's a really nice rooftop restaurant with amazing views. Want to go back and try their Thali options.\nGood but overpriced for what it is\nI recently had a fantastic experience at LW & highly recommend dining here. The salatim is outstanding and will satisfy all your snacking needs. We ordered several items a La carte and also the kebab from the grill. All the food was outstanding, & service is excellent. The view and vibe are great but the food at LW elevates this from a scene-y restaurant to a dining destination.\nFood is excellent. I'm sure you're better off coming in the summer so you get a full skyline view. It does feel like a one and done experience, the salatim is fantastic but since it's the majority of the experience, there doesn't feel like a need to go back as you're just then changing minor variables.\nFood is good but a little overpriced. If you\u2019re planning on dining there when it\u2019s cold outside you should know that it\u2019s an open air rooftop wrapped with some plastic sheets. We had to sit with our winter coats on.\nWe had a great experience,  from the cocktails to the salads, the mix grill ( 4 ppl) to the amazing view and attentive stuff. We will definitely recommend.\nLaser Wolf is awesome, from the salatim to the grilled meats (have the salmon, you won't regret it) to the wonderful service by Richie, this culinary experience is not to be missed. Even though it was a rainy night the view of Manhattan was wonderous. The whole experience made our birthday party a huge success!\n\"Had an outstanding experience here, sitting at the counter and overlooking the coal fire grill. The food was decadent, delicious, and absolutely delightful (triple d action). The unique dip spread with pita is worth the three week Resy wait.\n\nI had the salmon and my fianc\u00e9 had the brisket kabob and we were fully satiated after our meals. Prepare to unbutton your pants by the time you devour the scrumptious third course of soft serve ice cream.

A bit overpriced for what you get - basically middle eastern ban chan, and decent kabobs. Koobideh is not \u201cauthentic\u201d as the server would have you believe. Go a la carte unless you have four or more people and a big appetite.", "doc_id": "4e712392-15f9-46af-8447-f4449163b24d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "791fbc3f28ea7c804c2c6467f9097e26fdf8c78c251fbac481238cd5e5e7e695", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 39905, "end": 41712}, "relationships": {"1": "7b2cb8e1-4271-4f9e-9eaf-c02a9ddb4e29", "2": "bc4991c2-7bc5-4cf0-bac1-d675b9c03fb7"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
